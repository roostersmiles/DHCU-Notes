- Having a bit of difficulty in adjusting my note taking and summaries to the online space. I am much more used to doing my notes off line in print and having key themes identified at the top ahead of a discussion.

- Overall for the semester I found the annotations an easy way to engage with the materials and the open notebook great for taking live notes but found implementing a workflow that incorporated constant reflection in type difficult. 
- I can see how it will be useful to set up a notebook in this format for a large scale project with multiple authors and have adopted a similar approach for an ongoing project i have in my work life but within a setting where I am beholden mostly to myself I find it a time consuming. 
- Integrating notes from readings with thoughts and reactions as well as the notes from our in class discussions was helpful. Turning these into publishable summaries was a bit more tricky.
