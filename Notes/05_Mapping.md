## Annotations
- Neatline is a pretty user friendly example of this that doesn't necessarily rely solely on Google Maps as the template. http://neatline.org/
- This assignment prompts students with a series of questions that guide them through a structured critique of an historical map
- The Agas Map is a good example of this http://mapoflondon.uvic.ca/map.htm
- I like that mapping is not limited to solely GIS based maps that are tied to geography but also more interpretive forms of maps.
- If we are going to use them for something other than what most are familiar with them for, there needs to be some explanation.
- It is an accessible way for most to organize and understand information. Visually representing something on a map comes with its own assumptions, as discussed in the Drucker article, but it is helpful especially as it relates to a geographically focused historical event.
- I think it is important that digital humanities develop and expand its own methodologies, perhaps looking at the assumptions of others and improving upon them. I think there is value in a cross-discipline review.
- I hope that once this moment passes that the study of digital humanities doesn't stop the use of visualization all together rather imposes some rigor on the use of these, as they can be very helpful and illustrative of the findings of the analysis.
- Wonderful - An important distinction. When describing a qualitative database or set I tend to stay away from percentages for this same reason. Think of a news headline X% said XYZ implies some sense of statistical relevance to a population.
