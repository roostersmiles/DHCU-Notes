- Bjork - themes within each song to highlight different movements/information - using unique instruments
- tesla coil and gravity pendulum
- reactovolt - squares with sounds, connection between blocks and turn, hands on composition table
- share structures with listeners, music workshops so others can use it, play with the structure and hear what they made, direct impact
- gravity, counterpoint - baseline, teaching musical theory through physical elements
- counterpoint/baseline, singing along with it, similar to human/gravity relationship
- started with gut feeling = worked with others, different apps
- Virus - about failed relationships - killed the cell
- connecting biology with real life relationships and putting it on an ipad
- generative music, computer based composition
- ever different and changing created by a system
- pathway happens on its own
- collaboration between people and tech, more intent behind, a feedback loop between AI and reaction
- sound physical but can't see, different ways to how it is visualized in physical form
- soundscapes created, can't see it, sound not our immediate 
- original notes are sterile, expand and illstrate using senses - burning, smell, sounds
- a written description of effect of centuries, digital synethesia - how much do we miss
- experimental archiology - explore an object by using replica
- listening to the habitat over time, changes in sound - airplanes
- APP - virus attacking cell - song gets stuck, don't hear full story unless you let the cell die.
- musician not centred - participatory - access, explained, tied to external rhythms

- music loosing rich anaolg stuff, trained to expect crisp distinction between tonal values, digital strucutre
- choose change the user
- MIDI not correct, hear it wrong digital
- can tell things written in different environments
- reaction to music
- complicated ideas - machine vs by hand, machine facilitate verbal diarea, hands hurt longer you write
- graphic notation of sound, 
- up for interpretation, not as literal as sheet music, spend sometime to understand
- software to write like visulized pieces.
- format visual or traditional changes composition production
