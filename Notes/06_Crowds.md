## Reading Notes

### Rosenzweig
- Origns of wikipedia
- development of a review process and community based on previous interaction of trolls on the platform
- language use is neutral and a common format has been adopted byt the community based on their expectation of what an encyclopedia entry should be
- crowd means many eyes on an article, more eyes the higher quality the article once the reviews are complete
- ongoing debates on discussions tabs about key facts or issues in articles arising from NPOV requirement and interpretative nature of history
- different from 'possessive individualism' contrasts history 
- seems to me the most interested are self-selecting to monitor

Perhaps another interesting source for analysis, this ongoing discussion behind the articles. I had never really considered looking beyond the information presented in the article.

If the government has helped pay for it, should it not be more open source? I understand the need to increase funding through subscription to continually update and increase the content developed. Maybe a not for profit with a recovery model works best.

- roostersmiles, 1/3/2018 2:20:07 PM

Wonderful! 

- roostersmiles, 1/3/2018 2:17:22 PM

The style described above of laying out objectively both sides of an argument and including little interpretation does leave alot wanting in terms of content. The bibliography section is a helpful starting point for further reading on a topic.
I think, depending on the use case, Wikipedia is helpful, in academia as a starting point or reminder of a concept while working on something more complex, but elsewhere as a high-level overview when a detailed complex understanding is not necessary.

- roostersmiles, 1/3/2018 2:12:11 PM

That is worrying that the open source data mining capabilities have meant the content being republished as is in a different format that may lend more credibility than is due. The concern I guess is the size of the audience reading misinformation compared to other encyclopedias (although the 25 article sample size is minimal).

What strikes me here is all the evidence presented that Wikipedia sources can be helpful and trustworthy. In academia, we have been told to avoid it as a source and to follow their sources if we do reference it to the original. Perhaps knowing the page history is available we can identify the original author of what we are citing, although the presence of something on Wikipedia may imply a larger parallel to a "peer review" just without the expert peers expected in a journal. 

Again, I expect those making changes on a particular topic are invested in it in some way, either professionally or personally. 

- roostersmiles, 1/3/2018 2:08:18 PM

If you go through the main page it seems to be also organised by topics and "portals". Its not how I tend to use it as the search engine method typically lets me answer the question I am looking for. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:History 

- roostersmiles, 1/3/2018 2:34:04 AM

I suppose it is simpler to correct a Wiki article, but what goes online is always there in some form. 

- roostersmiles, 1/3/2018 2:26:11 AM

Its interesting how even though the community has "appropriated" norms it is still viewed as not well written. 

- roostersmiles, 1/3/2018 2:09:35 AM

I like that it uses "general public" language. I imagine that many articles suffer from jargon within an industry as those with the greatest stake in a subject will contribute, but its a great corpus to see what prose a community defines as useful compared to an editor.

- roostersmiles, 1/3/2018 1:32:31 AM

That is pretty awesome

- roostersmiles, 1/3/2018 1:21:11 AM

If what the author indicates above that the 19th Amendment is somehow missing from the history of the women's movement, I am also skeptical.

- roostersmiles, 1/3/2018 1:17:40 AM

What the public would choose typically is more fleeting and influenced by recent events. With recent movements to rename a lot of historical landmarks, the public does not like to be reminded of historical events that shed negative light based on modern sensibilities. 

- roostersmiles, 1/3/2018 1:04:16 AM

A more complex topic that overlaps with other articles is difficult to outline in a systematic way. We are so used to trying to clearly define where something ends and another thing begins. 
Similar to our own issues in building the DXProject outline.

- roostersmiles, 1/3/2018 12:55:41 AM

Is this because the write-ups keep getting deleted/revised when added.

- roostersmiles, 1/2/2018 9:55:17 PM

This is where multiple authors is helpful to fully illustrating alternative viewpoints and presenting them. Super helpful but it can be frustrating. At work we try hard to give each viewpoint some space but still presenting a level of degree as much as possible within a qualitative context. It is a tricky balance.

- roostersmiles, 1/2/2018 9:51:33 PM

Odd, I typically use Wikipedia to provide a definition for a term or concept. A bit more in depth I suppose than an entry in the Oxford Dictionary. 

- roostersmiles, 1/2/2018 9:48:55 PM

Love they reference Wikipedia about Wikipedia.

- roostersmiles, 1/2/2018 9:46:16 PM

I think Wikipedia has put in place mechanisms now to better vet content and their creators but find it interesting that something that started essentially being written by experts would flip so quickly in the interest of time.

- roostersmiles, 1/2/2018 9:40:37 PM

I agree, for some topics a common structure is very helpful, for others it might hinder the type of information shared/discussed. 

I think we should also ask how is it interpreted by those reading it? 

- roostersmiles, 1/2/2018 9:36:44 PM

A stark contrast to possessive individualism described above where not only does the author "lay claim" but also must be compensated for use of their work.

Wonderful that these open formats are almost viewed as owned by everyone as anyone can contribute.

- roostersmiles, 1/2/2018 9:33:03 PM

I think this is more intellectual possessive individualism, akin to Intellectual property, if it is collective work it is harder to reference and the "prestige" of the unique ideas is somehow lost. 

It is worrying that your reputation as an academic is tied to your "ownership" of thoughts and ideas.

- roostersmiles, 1/2/2018 9:30:03 PM

It might also be the nature of the work being done? I'd be interested to see if the divide is more experimental design research vs. literature review/interpretation rather than solely science / humanities & arts. Experimental design sometimes requires working collaboratively across many different task. Culture within the profession also likely plays into it.

- roostersmiles, 1/3/2018 2:54:49 AM

or a sense of "otherness" as need be. 

### scholz - Crowdmilking
- crowdsourcing is bad for organised labour
- contrast 'volunteer' contributors from Wiki with low paid groups 
- relationship between owners of platforms and content creators, the risk/costs being taken on are different
-

## Class Notes
- Erving Goffman's presentation of self - virtual space - actors to meet in time, no copresence required
- FB need real name - use of other identities online
- tressy mcmillan cottam, 
- Community:personal, intentional engagement, common interest/shared values, self identified, group label impact how they see themselves, demographic label/imposed (control)
  - includes things like "ethnic" communities, where a sense of homogenity is implied
- Crowds: less personal, mob mentality, temporary, self-serving ind in a group, negative, dog pile
- Alternative : Network (less implied positive connections), 
### Trad vs. Virtual Communities Digital Virtual Community
Physical
- Limitations - geographic location, social community 'group think', stereotype
- Affordances - face-to-face, emotional expression, know is human

Virtual
- Limitations - non-humans, third actor (tech), quality of engagement dependant on platform, accessibility?, trolls, priveldge a part, digital literacy, developped by 'white dudes on the internet'
- Affordances - not limited by geography, access/isolation, allows minority viewpoint to express themselves, personal identity/confidence
### Crowsourcing Projects
- Waze - carpool options?
- Encyclopedia of Life - all 1.9 million species, description 
- Wikipedia - more contributors, strong articles, starting point, vandalism not as common as some think, obvious rather than hidden
- Wiki Stream?
- Lying about the past - propeganda for past, last American Pirate/historical hoax 99% true, series of fake posts, 
- Freedoms sacrificed in a system, violations and rules, can stay if not persistant
- evolution of heavy metal umlaut, rock dots, 
- copyright of 1911 britannica over and wiki pulled it in at the start
- structure of wiki came out of negotiated edit wars, tables of contents, headings, 
- Durkheim - social facts - reveals beleifs and values, 
- revealing public interest, collective memory, 
- Kate Middleton's dress - males wanted to delete it, various weapons in others, dress more interest in public, 
### Misperception and Rumor Communities
- easy to share information, fake news, echo chambers, attract people, information received agreed,
- Chris Schaffer - world gone sidewise, 'fake news', 
- Mike Caulfeild, web-fact checking for students, research institue, building resources informed digital literacy
- posts things, like pizzagate - how to debunk, how do you read it, follow it backwards, 
- what can be done? break networks
- not nec instituitons that are credible but ways to confirm credibility, 
- check previous work, read laterally, what other people say about the source, more informed paths
- re-affirming beleifs, weaponization of information in terms of networking structure,
- public humanities, need more people to think about it and how to engage, 
- institutional platforms still matter, weight important
- cascades in networks - how things are interconnected, different outcomes
- how things connect and network dynamics to set off cascade, complex interactions can allow for huge transformation quickly
### Education
- Grinnell Beowulf - sense of community, open to future students
- AnnoTate - training and hands on experience with transcribing and annotating, guide how to do it, giving people the skills
- zooniverse - crowdsourcing projects arts/science
### Labour
- Care work of DH - Caretaker
- Paige Morgan - not your DH fairy
- Power, early industrial revolution
- lack of regulation, if you dont we'll find someone else willing, worker not given much power
- socio-economic, income gap, no other means, 
- look at other shifts in labour force - invisible part of society doing work, behind a screen, invisible, paid less/not at all
- gig economy, undermine an exisiting framework, 
- intellectual property
- peice of puzzle, assembeled outside realhm of knowledge
- micropasts, little research tasks, transcribing things
- work done within Uni, Prof puts name on it and $$ but students support and do work
- facilitators, juggling balls, brining together, vital, but no credit
- colonial baggage and structure hard to shake, menpower, women doing care and grads doing work
- can you find who did the work?
- tracing origins
- give credit to those who contribute, annotations
- Gamification - for gold stars vs. $$
- micro pasts, good community building but not getting around payment
- Beth Mobinski
- interesting mostly women talking about labour in DH, engage with it lead by women
- serious on ATM - women
- important to foreground the DX project
- gendered labour
### Formal network analysis - Shawn
- network structures and what they do to things, 
- well connected pages - more likely to be good, SEO in part based on this, not # of likes but well connected to well connected
- signal of value, high betweeness centrality = Google
- Facebook - can get strong interlinkages, some other links, triadic closure, closes possibilites for other knowledge?, 'weak ties' - in career searches is best, triadic eliminates this, meta networks, 
- one mode vs two mode statistics - categorical difference, assumption, need same vs. different entities
### Other
- LyreBird - Radio Lab,
## DX-Project
- outlines and drafts into pressbooks
