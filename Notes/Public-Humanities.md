# Public Humanities Notes
- Over the course of the development of the materials for the PH seminar class I started in a word document with key themes I had identified and built out a PPT deck covering key questions and a breakdown for the discussion. I created a discussion guide to facilitate an engaged dialogue on the topic and ran through some real word examples.

worrying - studying radicalization to violence right now and troll behaviour seems linked between the online space and offline.

## roostersmiles, 2/5/2018 3:24:11 AM

a useful concept for our discussion of anonymity in the online context

## roostersmiles, 2/5/2018 3:20:00 AM

This is an interesting thought, deindividualized there is more room to be a troll and act inappropriately, but if start to regularly disclose otherwise anonymous user names in situations where there is harm done, would this change?

The divide exists outside just digital scholarship

## roostersmiles, 2/5/2018 12:23:02 AM

This article highlights the difference between a digital focused public humanities and a public focused digital humanities. The public needs to be involved from the start and an understanding of the audience needs to be incorporated in the project.

## roostersmiles, 2/5/2018 12:16:30 AM

Compared to other projects where the audience is academic, these public projects must take into account a different common base of knowlegde as a starting point.

## roostersmiles, 2/4/2018 2:10:54 PM

This is one of the themes I wanted to discuss related to PH. the connection to authority and whether these discussions in the public space warp the perception of authority within the minds of the audience.

## roostersmiles, 2/4/2018 2:09:39 PM

Ok, so here Public Humanities is back to being made accessible for the public rather than by the public, but suggests that this approach needed to be reviewed.

## roostersmiles, 2/4/2018 2:08:11 PM

I like the connection to history as a service, preserving and making it available to the public. 

## roostersmiles, 2/4/2018 1:45:08 PM

Starting to see the argument here, that digital does not necessarily mean public. It cannot just be access by the public but needs to involve them in some way in the creation?

## roostersmiles, 2/4/2018 1:40:04 PM

Interesting the choice of word order impacts the relationship or perceived priority for the author between public and digital. Public Digital being first and foremost community focused in digital sphere while Digital Public being digitally focused in a public sphere. It surprises me because I had thought both were more closely integrated and would have pegged her definitions the other way. Interested to see where she goes with it.

### defining PH

I like the illustrative description of "cracking open history" and the connection to democracy. Though I fear that a popular opinion approach to history needs to incorporate some critical thinking and added context.

An interesting point, what return on investment can you get for the time spent on a DH blog. Writing experience and perhaps moderated discussions.

## roostersmiles, 2/2/2018 2:47:59 AM

This is a way to reach more people with your ideas. It really mirrors a lot of our initial discussions around crowds and social media.

## roostersmiles, 2/2/2018 2:45:07 AM

providing context again seen as really important

## roostersmiles, 2/2/2018 2:41:20 AM

I wonder what the audience is for these articles, given the expense and great lengths that people go through to publish. 

## roostersmiles, 2/2/2018 2:39:35 AM

Those established in an industry want to maintain the status qo or don't understand the process of some methods and so discourage their use. 

## roostersmiles, 2/2/2018 2:35:18 AM

The pressure to publish within academia. This seems akin to whether a self-published work is worth something to the discussion, reputation and future directions of the field. Is it 'worth' something typically translates to dollars. The author obviously places a lot of personal importance on this project and the work put in must be worth it or the site wouldn't exist.

## roostersmiles, 2/2/2018 2:31:11 AM

I think this sums up DH nicely, the audience it addresses is the Public perspective, who can access the scholarship.

## roostersmiles, 1/28/2018 5:39:06 PM

The social networks and connections made online have started to build the expectations. It is a marketplace of ideas.

## roostersmiles, 1/28/2018 5:05:23 PM

In talking to visible minorities about career options in the past there have been a lot of discussions about being careful to choose programs of study that will result in a professional career. Changing the narrative is important but also perception of the study of the humanities as a career path.

## roostersmiles, 1/28/2018 3:05:04 PM

In perception, expectation often informs our experience of an event, program or in this case artifact. If it does not meet our expectations of what it was thought to be going in, often the reaction is negative. 

## roostersmiles, 1/28/2018 4:36:33 PM

An interesting prediction, I wonder what else will shift in our lifetimes.

## roostersmiles, 1/28/2018 2:35:31 PM

Diversity is important across all fields. In other humanities disciplines and outside. I did research for DND on recruiting visible minorities to the CAF and this was similarly one of the key things that made it seem like a viable career option, seeing others like them in successful positions within the CAF.

## roostersmiles, 1/28/2018 2:02:56 PM

This raises an interesting issue, humans are fallible and capable of both constructive and deconstruction contributions to thought and debate. We are removing historical figures names from buildings, monuments and other places of honour who upon reflection have represented both important events in our collective history but also darker motives and causes. 
Over time societies social mores change, and our views of past events shift with these changes.

The impact new technologies can have in better understanding the past is awesome.
