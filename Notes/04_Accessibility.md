Wonderful - For the general public in research we try to stick to an 8th grade reading level or lower.

Weird - We are using an alphabet that doesn't reflect the phonological structure of most of the languages we use it for and for some the letters are indistinguishable. Wonder what it is like with more morphological driven writing systems like Simplified Chinese.
A bit of a tangent but this made me think of a Freakenomics series I've been listening to. It has an interesting series on their podcast called Earth 2.0 where they are exploring how we would remake human systems if we could design them from scratch. Would we create a more efficient/universal language?

Wonderful - I am currently going through the process of learning a new alphabet in my Pubjabi classes. The different hand writing styles of my teacher and the more advanced students compared to what is in our textbook can at times make it difficult for me to distinguish different letters. 
In English, the context tends to help with this (like homonyms) but with neurodiverse individuals this might work differently.

Would you not be able to find a font that works for you and use it kind of as your user default? Is it something more about the environment the font is in?

Wonderful - Let the user drive the way they access your content. Technically, I'm not sure how to achieve this but love the direction.

I think these examples are a great tie in to shawn's push to future proof our work. The underlying content can be manipulated in different ways by technology to cater to different needs.

I think it is important to consider starting off from a point of accessibility as well as adapting for experiences but it might depend on the use case. 

In some video games for example, the use of sound in certain scenarios is meant to be a part of the narrative experience and gameplay that might ultimately change the narrative intended by the creator/author/designer if it was text-based or in another format. I think it parallels to translation depending on the medium, some nuance can be lost.

## roostersmiles, 11/18/2017 11:58:18 PM

I agree, this is an important point, it can be for everyone. When we build from an open accessible point to begin with we can improve the user experience for everyone by allowing alternate means to interact with a project/site/program. For example building better voice-navigation platforms for technology can benefit even those who are 'able-bodied'. 

## roostersmiles, 11/18/2017 11:52:35 PM

Wonderful - There is a choice you need to make as a designer, as a creator, who is the audience? Will you focus on the majority or those 'like me' or do you do the work to make it inclusive/accessible for others? It can be easy to do 'what works' and in some cases appropriate, but it depends on what you are doing and how you define your audience.

At work I get the line from some suppliers to include accessibility (WCAG 2.0 AAA) limits the user experience and find it frustrating that they are making a choice for us who our audience is. 

## roostersmiles, 11/18/2017 11:43:17 PM

What might make something work for one audience/group can often contradict others, sometimes design by subgroup is necessary. A fun puzzle.

## roostersmiles, 11/19/2017 2:19:59 AM

Can we connect with a character on the basis of their actions? It would be an interesting test two stories one with a 'normalizing' characteristic and one without to see how the view of narrative changes.

This reminds me strongly of the discourse around the LGBTQ+ rights movement. 

## roostersmiles, 11/19/2017 2:15:47 AM

Wonderful - Interesting in the discussions I was involved in for Canadian Content in Digital, the focus was on cultural, linguistic and LGBT viewpoints in our cultural materials. The thought that diversity in content would drive acceptance and diversity in thinking, strengthening Canada's culture. It makes sense that 'disability' be included in this. I find myself struggling for a descriptor for this.

## roostersmiles, 11/19/2017 2:04:18 AM

Its interesting how we tend to focus on accessibility as it relates to vision but we don't see people wearing corrective tech (glasses/contacts) as having some disability. In other cases we see assistive or corrective tech as an identifier for those who are not 'able-bodied'.

Cool, I've been doing the same at a slower pace on public opinion and policy.
# Lecture Notes
- A11Y - shortform for Twitter, 
- Accessibility what does it include/not include
General
- Assistive technology
- sensory accessibility - visual, auditory, speech
- motor - physical learning, kinesthetic
- visible vs. non-visible
- cognitive - colourblindness
Digital
- broad format for assistive tech
- intrinsiclly accessible vs. adaptive
- interoperability (raw formats) - content across areas
- Laptop/mobile accessibility - availability across platforms/devices
- usability - UX - interaction or use of content, use of language
- problems platforms bring up that are different from traditional
- context specific
Bias and sterotypes
- belief - able = norm, abnormal
- put onus on 'disabled' to adapt to us rather, disability defined through consensus
- age, disability - 'getting old' - issues faced the same
- assistive vs. adaptive
- adaptive - sits on top of other technology, make it accessible
- assistive - perform with current abilities - hearing aides, ramps, eye glasses etc...
- more comfort with assistive
### Where?
Public Spaces
- assumptions - about access (accompanying), retrofit has to fit on exisitng design
- history of accessibility - university platform for learning - does disabiling, 
- online government - convience, public facing accessible, min requires, moving to universal design
- online shopping, public space?, difficult if inflexible
- implimentation different - democratic process, action/strike/rallies, participation different
- stats can - definitions of disability - 11% aggregated - unemployment
- social participation - language access, difficult to participate in shared experience
- localised social networks - adverse effect on mental health, social cohesion - othering
- translation platform, changing translation - based on concenus? interpretation of policy
- accessibility can be contextual
- attending class virtually difficult. 
- plain language in academia - known for thick
- theoretical levels, build context to contribute
- Paeget - cog development - assimulating in mental models - change to accomodate new
- imposter syndrom - credibility, presitge, professionalisation - box in to better define
- use of shortcuts makes it inaccessible as well - final publication need to stay or be 'translated' to allow access
- power dynamic - oral traditions/ history reliance on text - dominant narrative - value expert over experience
### Activity
- relatability - bring to their experience level, assimulate the knowledge
- information to share but get information across without complexity. 
### Compliance online
- WCAG 2.0 - advisory body W3 for web content
- align as many as possible, imprvements over time - changing
- W3C guidance around coding, content oriented
- up to developpers to be requirement but meaningful
- interoperable/robust - consistency in interpretations
- use of colour
- captioned media - alternative format/text 
### Activity #2
### Social constructs
- othering, intrisiclly different
- perspective of contribution from inside - content inside container- where value lies, contribute to create knowldge in experience
- differently abled - 
- universal design, not every situation
- thread within academis - use of laptops in the class room, power relationships
- laptop free zones
- building social communities on shared experiences
- not disabled - differently abled
- what is doing the disabiling? 
- tendancy to build for others like us
- ethical design manifesto - design firm, own copy - remixed
- simple easy framework to make case - not complex issues
- human experience not easily comparmentalized
- inclusion is doing with, why justifies exclusion
### FInal thoughts
- approach in addressing - the New Education - Kathy Davidson - Haystak
- group mutlidisciplanry
- 
## Shawn's Talk
- ethical design
- profhacker
- crafting digital history - shorting out back
