I wonder if we can in some ways compare the blogging of ideas to perhaps research notes or journals of past scholars, but in a public way. I would prefer if blogging were viewed more as 'ideas in development' rather than a stated published work similar to a peer reviewed article. If we can treat it as a way to spark debate and further discussion while forming ideas/opinions about a topic rather than as perhaps a finished product. 

I think the format and conventions of blogs, being opinion-based first-person accounts, lends it self well to this context. Blogging to me is a more subjective form than others.

I'm not super familiar with history as a discipline, but I assume 'argument' here means supported opinion/interpretation as opposed to factual representation? A more subjective interpretation of events rather than a recital of knowns.

I'm curious if 'ownership' here is in terms of profitability (financial or otherwise) of the debate or 'ownership' in terms of taking responsibility for shepherding/curating history. I think both have different implications on the future directions of digital humanities. 

Looking at the Indigenous Rights and Reconciliation debates in the Canadian political environment now,  I can't help but compare the 'ownership' of our past as a country and the connection to efforts (however effective/ineffective) for reconciliation.

I agree, respect is an important part of inclusion within the discourse.

I agree, access to the same internet is important but also the ability to use what they have accessed to. We talked about this in Accessibility as well, that language barriers, filters and other investments in infrastructure can limit the ability to 'level the playing field'. There is also the issues we discussed alongside Social Media, of discrimination and the individually different impacts of publicly discussing issues online.

I think digital platforms might offer both, perpetual inaccuracies as well as the opportunity to open the  discussion about the origins of these inaccuracies and sharing additional context/perspectives. It might be easier to put ideas out there but making them heard can be difficult.

I agree. It is super important to include a description of methodology for the ability for others to confirm, however with digital tools, I think doing this can be a bit easier to both keep track of yourself and to report to others. A researcher's notes were not necessarily published alongside their article, but with things like Github we can be more open about the process to getting to the conclusions in our research.

This is really cool, I like the use of mapping to identify different points of conflict. The application to a broader discussion is important in terms of reconciliation. Police services use mapping to identify crime in neighbourhoods across our city, we can think about the social context in the same lens.

I agree, looking at source materials in a new way can be really insightful. The example that really sticks with me is the colour blocking of Disney films in our discussion of visualization.

It will be interesting to see how historical research is developed in the future, as we can "look back" at online social media and digitally archived data from the internet to provide additional context and "read" these on the street level conversations.

I like the idea of imposing a structure and categorization on notes. We've started using NVivo for this at work across multiple streams of input and it is helpful to identify common threads over time.

It also opens it up beyond academia, to allow those not necessarily committed to investing in tuition to access the same materials.

# Lecutre Notes
- definitions of publishing
- Publish - disseminating information
- become an authority, weakens positions those who are authorities, engaged in different ways in discourse
-other publishing network vs. process with apublisher, websites, small press,
- different methods of going about it. 
- Academic work different processes. 
- question credibility and biases
- filter before publiscation, now publish then filter - order has adjusted
- range of rights to retain over your own work,
- how to get published? the fine print, contracting etc...
- filter through 'fine print' of getting work out there, what happens after, unpaid labour complicates things
- connection to public humanities - definition of audience
- BC Open text book - publishing in the open
- anxeity around printing, anyone can do it
- connection so social media and fake notes
- 
- middleground
- transcribe bantham - tried to get scholars to make sense of it
- journals and capitalism - couple in planned obsolescence, university publishing houses, how much $$ they make, doesnt have to be this way. More like a business - could transform structure to have uni invest into it, rather than depend on sales
- business model by crowd funding, content creators to lone wolf it - less middle men
- don't phsycially have it - can someone take it away from you, in a sense have it everywhere
- reputation economy in academia related to publishing, purchase the name of journal, edit produce,40-50% off of you to take it 
- critical consumers, if in X journal must be good
- open publishing event- name behind, if trying to put it out there, reputation of journal itself - everything top notch, they own your work for ever
- Shawn - embargo on digital version for 2 years, negoiating 
- want to share digital copy with students, pulled out of it
- digital would undermine sales
- ROMEO - review of open sourced articles
- archives - can keep a copy of it, lodge copies - get unique tracking to it, when it is cited get caught, findable not hidden
- academia.edu - for profit
- more you learn about it the more you realize that you will loose control of your own work. 
- technically, depending how we define publishing - posted to public - "publishing"
- public facing draft- unsettles people to have partially finished
- same platform for a book
- ability to go back and edit
-- interesting the discussion of the shift of tech in process of writing even - notes and organisation and essential need to start with more organised research before typing compared to the ability to build and edit recursively
- reader is the least important person in this system
trying to plot it out can be useful
- conference on data publishing and final article - raw or cooked data - amazing the push back on idea of sharing the data, which quarters it was coming from. 
- if <60 - precariously employed more interested in open data and publishing rather than others
- closed data - pay for with data mortgages, only if you share mine, closed-linked data? - computer applications in archeology conference (40 years), senior group of archeology - GIS was the thing - computation and data you hold on to, others might do something to it
- Grad student - NDA - not publish using data with full knowledge of group
- metho and data - needed for replicability - what value does publisher add, 
- other models available -trying to pretend don't exist, can get people to do it for free
- posibility - open peer review take away power 
- peer review - get an e-mail saying we have this paper, please review and give someone else otherwise, no reward
- anonymity - collect gossi[/settle scores]
- women use first name rather than inital and last name
- increasingly active reader - contrast with rap genious or hypothesis fosters
- could conceive of online annotations as publishing.
- Self-publishing - novels and other things, even academically - rigourus process - months to do.
- not the same as other examples - Kindle and E-books think it has been mediated but could finish it in five minutes
- online journals overhead is cheaper
- scarcity of knowledge - with print - not justify the price use production as a reason
- cost per book - scarcity previous but now less
- imperial press - did give a good copy editor and marketing - historian's macroscope
- fan fiction - 
hypertext - hyperguard
