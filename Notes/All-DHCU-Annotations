I wonder if we can in some ways compare the blogging of ideas to perhaps research notes or journals of past scholars, but in a public way. I would prefer if blogging were viewed more as 'ideas in development' rather than a stated published work similar to a peer reviewed article. If we can treat it as a way to spark debate and further discussion while forming ideas/opinions about a topic rather than as perhaps a finished product. 

I think the format and conventions of blogs, being opinion-based first-person accounts, lends it self well to this context. Blogging to me is a more subjective form than others.

## roostersmiles, 3/25/2018 9:58:26 PM

I'm not super familiar with history as a discipline, but I assume 'argument' here means supported opinion/interpretation as opposed to factual representation? A more subjective interpretation of events rather than a recital of knowns.

## roostersmiles, 3/25/2018 9:32:46 PM

I'm curious if 'ownership' here is in terms of profitability (financial or otherwise) of the debate or 'ownership' in terms of taking responsibility for shepherding/curating history. I think both have different implications on the future directions of digital humanities. 

Looking at the Indigenous Rights and Reconciliation debates in the Canadian political environment now,  I can't help but compare the 'ownership' of our past as a country and the connection to efforts (however effective/ineffective) for reconciliation. 

## roostersmiles, 3/25/2018 9:28:53 PM

I agree, respect is an important part of inclusion within the discourse. 

## roostersmiles, 3/25/2018 9:27:10 PM

I agree, access to the same internet is important but also the ability to use what they have accessed to. We talked about this in Accessibility as well, that language barriers, filters and other investments in infrastructure can limit the ability to 'level the playing field'. There is also the issues we discussed alongside Social Media, of discrimination and the individually different impacts of publicly discussing issues online.

## roostersmiles, 3/25/2018 9:10:56 PM

I think digital platforms might offer both, perpetual inaccuracies as well as the opportunity to open the  discussion about the origins of these inaccuracies and sharing additional context/perspectives. It might be easier to put ideas out there but making them heard can be difficult.

## roostersmiles, 3/25/2018 9:06:08 PM

I agree. It is super important to include a description of methodology for the ability for others to confirm, however with digital tools, I think doing this can be a bit easier to both keep track of yourself and to report to others. A researcher's notes were not necessarily published alongside their article, but with things like Github we can be more open about the process to getting to the conclusions in our research.

## roostersmiles, 3/25/2018 9:03:20 PM

This is really cool, I like the use of mapping to identify different points of conflict. The application to a broader discussion is important in terms of reconciliation. Police services use mapping to identify crime in neighbourhoods across our city, we can think about the social context in the same lens.

## roostersmiles, 3/25/2018 9:00:46 PM

I agree, looking at source materials in a new way can be really insightful. The example that really sticks with me is the colour blocking of Disney films in our discussion of visualization.

## roostersmiles, 3/25/2018 8:23:02 PM

It will be interesting to see how historical research is developed in the future, as we can "look back" at online social media and digitally archived data from the internet to provide additional context and "read" these on the street level conversations.

## roostersmiles, 3/25/2018 7:52:42 PM

I like the idea of imposing a structure and categorization on notes. We've started using NVivo for this at work across multiple streams of input and it is helpful to identify common threads over time.

## roostersmiles, 3/25/2018 8:15:13 PM

It also opens it up beyond academia, to allow those not necessarily committed to investing in tuition to access the same materials.

## roostersmiles, 3/11/2018 5:24:50 AM

I like how this mirrors back to the initial discussion to text mining, reminding us how the analyst/researcher brings prior knowledge and experience to the table in interpreting results. There is always an inherent bias/subjectivity in how the data is collected, interpreted and communicated.

## roostersmiles, 3/11/2018 5:21:25 AM

It seems to me that almost any length of speech has some meaning to it, a hedge or expression of doubt. It is interesting we are talking about sound here in relation to speech and the written word.

## roostersmiles, 3/11/2018 5:17:37 AM

I think I'm on the fence about this. DH seems to be rooted to me in the digital space, in visualization and mapping, as with other discussions, we saw the focus put on using the digital space in different ways. 

Text mining does seem more accessible, especially for English and Linguistics disciplines, where a quantified, linked and clustered model of the smallest unit of meaning (the word or more accurately a morpheme) is relevant. 

However, syntax, prosody and cadence are also significant in analyzing written and oral text, and perhaps needs more focus in this domain of DH.

## roostersmiles, 3/11/2018 5:14:29 AM

Thanks! I would have had to look this up as well. 

I'm a bit worried about the argument that the word is indisputable. There is a lot of ambiguity in how we use language and the intended meaning can often be lost in the written word. 

## roostersmiles, 3/11/2018 5:04:19 AM

I like this thought that text mining is somehow more familiar to most researchers in DH. 

## roostersmiles, 2/26/2018 12:09:51 AM

Interesting, I had thought the dicotomy was more "creative" like the use of creativity in the application of ideas/concepts in novel areas and "Creative" as those specifically within "Arts" disciplines.

## roostersmiles, 2/25/2018 11:52:46 PM

I like that the underlying message that perhaps our relationship with "productive" means of creativity is misplaced. We have too many things in our lives. 

Also, failure is helpful for innovation but not necessarily for productivity.

## roostersmiles, 2/25/2018 11:46:31 PM

I'm curious what the "above productivity" element is alluding to. Like we are not mass producing or that the outcome is not necessarily productively creative?

## roostersmiles, 2/25/2018 11:34:15 PM

"I made this"

## roostersmiles, 2/25/2018 11:16:02 PM

I think she is alluding to the groups they target by "purchase power" and spend within a category by easy to identify demographic characteristics (region, age, gender) rather than psycho-graphic characteristics (personality traits and needs) of the user. Depending on the product and needs this has started to shift, with niche marketing becoming easier and easier, although potentially less lucrative than the en-mass genres.

## roostersmiles, 2/25/2018 11:11:06 PM

Of simplifying the creative process? Or enabling a wider audience to be "creative".

## roostersmiles, 2/25/2018 11:08:14 PM

We used to make friendship bracelets by hand by tying knots... I may have at one point had a solid plastic "wheel" to assist the process and keep the strings separated. 

## roostersmiles, 2/25/2018 11:01:17 PM

Wonderful! I like the idea of engaging students with the creative process from a "peer" perspective. 

## roostersmiles, 2/25/2018 10:56:45 PM

It would be interesting to see what different paths were the most common among players. This might be an interesting research instrument for the role of different narrative devices in decision making/outcomes. Which pieces of information are essential for certain decisions at a later point in the game?

## roostersmiles, 2/25/2018 10:54:03 PM

Cool, seems like an easy approach. It seems like a similar approach to hypertext novels but with perhaps different goals and conventions.

## roostersmiles, 2/25/2018 10:38:00 PM

I agree, I also think its a great way to teach a concept through action. Attempting different permutations within a game and getting different results can help to solidify core concepts.

## roostersmiles, 2/19/2018 10:14:24 PM

I like that it is also an exploration of something more. By working with the photos you gain knowledge about the original intent of the photographer and context by purposefully or playfully altering it.

## roostersmiles, 2/5/2018 3:27:18 AM

worrying - studying radicalization to violence right now and troll behaviour seems linked between the online space and offline.

## roostersmiles, 2/5/2018 3:24:11 AM

a useful concept for our discussion of anonymity in the online context

## roostersmiles, 2/5/2018 3:20:00 AM

This is an interesting thought, deindividualized there is more room to be a troll and act inappropriately, but if start to regularly disclose otherwise anonymous user names in situations where there is harm done, would this change?

## roostersmiles, 2/5/2018 2:33:00 AM

The divide exists outside just digital scholarship

## roostersmiles, 2/5/2018 12:23:02 AM

This article highlights the difference between a digital focused public humanities and a public focused digital humanities. The public needs to be involved from the start and an understanding of the audience needs to be incorporated in the project.

## roostersmiles, 2/5/2018 12:16:30 AM

Compared to other projects where the audience is academic, these public projects must take into account a different common base of knowlegde as a starting point.

## roostersmiles, 2/4/2018 2:10:54 PM

This is one of the themes I wanted to discuss related to PH. the connection to authority and whether these discussions in the public space warp the perception of authority within the minds of the audience.

## roostersmiles, 2/4/2018 2:09:39 PM

Ok, so here Public Humanities is back to being made accessible for the public rather than by the public, but suggests that this approach needed to be reviewed.

## roostersmiles, 2/4/2018 2:08:11 PM

I like the connection to history as a service, preserving and making it available to the public. 

## roostersmiles, 2/4/2018 1:45:08 PM

Starting to see the argument here, that digital does not necessarily mean public. It cannot just be access by the public but needs to involve them in some way in the creation?

## roostersmiles, 2/4/2018 1:40:04 PM

Interesting the choice of word order impacts the relationship or perceived priority for the author between public and digital. Public Digital being first and foremost community focused in digital sphere while Digital Public being digitally focused in a public sphere. It surprises me because I had thought both were more closely integrated and would have pegged her definitions the other way. Interested to see where she goes with it.

## roostersmiles, 2/4/2018 1:36:52 PM

### defining PH

I like the illustrative description of "cracking open history" and the connection to democracy. Though I fear that a popular opinion approach to history needs to incorporate some critical thinking and added context.

## roostersmiles, 2/2/2018 3:00:44 AM

An interesting point, what return on investment can you get for the time spent on a DH blog. Writing experience and perhaps moderated discussions.

## roostersmiles, 2/2/2018 2:47:59 AM

This is a way to reach more people with your ideas. It really mirrors a lot of our initial discussions around crowds and social media.

## roostersmiles, 2/2/2018 2:45:07 AM

providing context again seen as really important

## roostersmiles, 2/2/2018 2:41:20 AM

I wonder what the audience is for these articles, given the expense and great lengths that people go through to publish. 

## roostersmiles, 2/2/2018 2:39:35 AM

Those established in an industry want to maintain the status qo or don't understand the process of some methods and so discourage their use. 

## roostersmiles, 2/2/2018 2:35:18 AM

The pressure to publish within academia. This seems akin to whether a self-published work is worth something to the discussion, reputation and future directions of the field. Is it 'worth' something typically translates to dollars. The author obviously places a lot of personal importance on this project and the work put in must be worth it or the site wouldn't exist.

## roostersmiles, 2/2/2018 2:31:11 AM

I think this sums up DH nicely, the audience it addresses is the Public perspective, who can access the scholarship.

## roostersmiles, 1/28/2018 5:39:06 PM

The social networks and connections made online have started to build the expectations. It is a marketplace of ideas.

## roostersmiles, 1/28/2018 5:05:23 PM

In talking to visible minorities about career options in the past there have been a lot of discussions about being careful to choose programs of study that will result in a professional career. Changing the narrative is important but also perception of the study of the humanities as a career path.

## roostersmiles, 1/28/2018 3:05:04 PM

In perception, expectation often informs our experience of an event, program or in this case artifact. If it does not meet our expectations of what it was thought to be going in, often the reaction is negative. 

## roostersmiles, 1/28/2018 4:36:33 PM

An interesting prediction, I wonder what else will shift in our lifetimes.

## roostersmiles, 1/28/2018 2:35:31 PM

Diversity is important across all fields. In other humanities disciplines and outside. I did research for DND on recruiting visible minorities to the CAF and this was similarly one of the key things that made it seem like a viable career option, seeing others like them in successful positions within the CAF.

## roostersmiles, 1/28/2018 2:02:56 PM

This raises an interesting issue, humans are fallible and capable of both constructive and deconstruction contributions to thought and debate. We are removing historical figures names from buildings, monuments and other places of honour who upon reflection have represented both important events in our collective history but also darker motives and causes. 
Over time societies social mores change, and our views of past events shift with these changes.  
http://www.macleans.ca/society/james-bond-was-a-rapist/

## roostersmiles, 1/28/2018 1:41:21 PM

The impact new technologies can have in better understanding the past is awesome. 

## roostersmiles, 1/20/2018 10:31:41 PM

I agree as well, it is important that academia be able to perform this role, however political climate and financial pressures might not always mean it is possible. A part of it is also fear from the institution in some cases, when they may be afraid their funding would be impacted by challenging positions/pieces. 
I would be curious to see if anyone has reviewed this in a Canadian context and what the experience is at Canadian institutions. 

## roostersmiles, 1/20/2018 9:38:07 PM

This is why it is so important that we foster dialogue with individuals with different perspectives and backgrounds.

## roostersmiles, 1/20/2018 9:31:17 PM

Do the equalizing factors of technology push ideological shifts in some groups' perspectives on roles and inequalities within society, is it supporting a sentiment that was already present and facilitating the spread of ideas?

## roostersmiles, 1/20/2018 7:39:17 PM

Interesting: a tight network

## roostersmiles, 1/20/2018 7:37:07 PM

It is difficult to filter out noise, this is why a manual review is so important.

## roostersmiles, 1/20/2018 7:35:53 PM

A network of bots retweeting makes it difficult to distinguish 'real' data from fake. I like that they have developed a way to identify them. However, while the content they are posting is not a 'real' position on an issue in that it represents an individual, it is still being viewed and read by others, informing their opinions and leading to further polarization and influence. 

## roostersmiles, 1/20/2018 6:47:47 PM

### social media, methods

Cool, using existing models to extend and apply to existing models. 

## roostersmiles, 1/20/2018 6:25:23 PM

Like a proximity index?

## roostersmiles, 1/20/2018 6:14:33 PM

They started well before the election, interesting how their study of propaganda evolved.

## roostersmiles, 1/20/2018 5:58:41 PM

This is an important distinction. They are connected by the information that they are sharing but the sources are not all linked to the cause, they pick and choose what facts back them up.

## roostersmiles, 1/20/2018 5:25:10 PM

Cool! I had never thought about including the domains for links within my searches. Excited to try this.

## roostersmiles, 1/20/2018 5:19:33 PM

How did they identify the networks? Search based on a topic analysis.

## roostersmiles, 1/20/2018 5:15:04 PM

I like that this is a live update, interesting to see how it is shared. I love the idea of a public live monitor. I tend to do small scans on issues for clients that stay private.

## roostersmiles, 1/20/2018 5:12:54 PM

I'd really like to see the data from before the election and over time. Interesting to see that it has continued. 

## roostersmiles, 1/8/2018 8:20:23 PM

The categories on the margin are helpful if you were on an exploratory search.

## roostersmiles, 1/7/2018 5:29:13 PM

and disconnected from the companies that employ them. Work culture seems to be pushing toward the 'gig economy'. 

## roostersmiles, 1/7/2018 5:10:27 PM

very Marxist. Discussions around digital content creation often focus on bringing the means for mass communication down to the masses, however it seems in practice the power has again been given to a few to control. While anyone can create a blog, post a tweet or comment on social media, it is rare for it to gain attention or go viral without support by someone with more social clout, and even harder to make money for it. 
Some blogs, trying to remain independent, ask for donations from their readers in order to support the production of new materials. I wonder how successful they can be in breaking even or making a living this way.

## roostersmiles, 1/7/2018 4:55:29 PM

So true, we are seeing the music and film industries dealing with this in different ways now.

## roostersmiles, 1/7/2018 4:54:30 PM

Do we have an ethical obligation to refrain from this practice or to our shareholders to continue to exploit those willing to provide this work at a low rate in order to save on costs? How do you balance this as a decision-maker? 

## roostersmiles, 1/7/2018 4:52:09 PM

Do the designers who are not successful have the right to use their design again elsewhere or does the client who only paid the other own it? 

## roostersmiles, 1/7/2018 4:50:45 PM

Like a staffing agency?

## roostersmiles, 1/7/2018 3:59:34 PM

Is the issues the end goals of the organizations and the profit-driven approach of the 'corporate' intermediaries. Facebook would be OK if they were not selling our data? 

## roostersmiles, 1/7/2018 3:54:12 PM

The issues of 'screen-time' and the fear that we are doing something negative to our culture and society with the increased focus on online lives, that rather than augmenting our complimenting our lives we are somehow detracting from it. 

## roostersmiles, 1/7/2018 3:39:18 PM

Are we becoming this or has this been in process over the last century? The entertainment and advertisement industries have been using audience as a commodity for decades, we have started shifting it to other industries online.

## roostersmiles, 1/7/2018 3:36:51 PM

Similar to the 'contests' for content development or unpaid internships at big firms. Do the job to gain experience, but if a business can expect to get something for nothing its hard to start paying for it. It also though connects to the market's willingness to provide free labour and knowing the worth of your work product. Especially for those entering the workforce this can be hard to measure.

## roostersmiles, 1/7/2018 3:32:59 PM

Not totally related but made me think about the social media reaction to the new minimum wage increases in Ontario. In part the debate surrounds the redistribution of wealth and the willingness for those with power to forgo profit for an ethical understanding. 

## roostersmiles, 1/7/2018 3:17:21 PM

In contrast to the vast majority of small bloggers who take on both the direct costs and risk themselves, paying a service like Wordpress to host their content.

## roostersmiles, 1/7/2018 3:08:53 PM

Two or three years ago market research was all about the 'gamification' of data collection and participation in research. 

## roostersmiles, 1/7/2018 3:02:25 PM

Interesting - Scholtz spends so much time setting himself up as an expert in digital labour heading into the article. 

## roostersmiles, 1/7/2018 2:45:27 PM

Is it not enough or the feeling of a need to do more to stand out. The author connects it in part to the 2007-2009 recession, perhaps it is connected to the feeling even if you have a job that you need to somehow continue to 'do more' to get ahead.

## roostersmiles, 1/3/2018 3:10:09 PM

Perhaps another interesting source for analysis, this ongoing discussion behind the articles. I had never really considered looking beyond the information presented in the article. 

## roostersmiles, 1/3/2018 2:25:15 PM

If the government has helped pay for it, should it not be more open source? I understand the need to increase funding through subscription to continually update and increase the content developed. Maybe a not for profit with a recovery model works best.

## roostersmiles, 1/3/2018 2:20:07 PM

Wonderful! 

## roostersmiles, 1/3/2018 2:17:22 PM

The style described above of laying out objectively both sides of an argument and including little interpretation does leave alot wanting in terms of content. The bibliography section is a helpful starting point for further reading on a topic.
I think, depending on the use case, Wikipedia is helpful, in academia as a starting point or reminder of a concept while working on something more complex, but elsewhere as a high-level overview when a detailed complex understanding is not necessary.

## roostersmiles, 1/3/2018 2:12:11 PM

That is worrying that the open source data mining capabilities have meant the content being republished as is in a different format that may lend more credibility than is due. The concern I guess is the size of the audience reading misinformation compared to other encyclopedias (although the 25 article sample size is minimal). 

## roostersmiles, 1/3/2018 2:09:07 PM

What strikes me here is all the evidence presented that Wikipedia sources can be helpful and trustworthy. In academia, we have been told to avoid it as a source and to follow their sources if we do reference it to the original. Perhaps knowing the page history is available we can identify the original author of what we are citing, although the presence of something on Wikipedia may imply a larger parallel to a "peer review" just without the expert peers expected in a journal. 

Again, I expect those making changes on a particular topic are invested in it in some way, either professionally or personally. 

## roostersmiles, 1/3/2018 2:08:18 PM

If you go through the main page it seems to be also organised by topics and "portals". Its not how I tend to use it as the search engine method typically lets me answer the question I am looking for. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:History 

## roostersmiles, 1/3/2018 2:34:04 AM

I suppose it is simpler to correct a Wiki article, but what goes online is always there in some form. 

## roostersmiles, 1/3/2018 2:26:11 AM

Its interesting how even though the community has "appropriated" norms it is still viewed as not well written. 

## roostersmiles, 1/3/2018 2:09:35 AM

I like that it uses "general public" language. I imagine that many articles suffer from jargon within an industry as those with the greatest stake in a subject will contribute, but its a great corpus to see what prose a community defines as useful compared to an editor.

## roostersmiles, 1/3/2018 1:32:31 AM

That is pretty awesome

## roostersmiles, 1/3/2018 1:21:11 AM

If what the author indicates above that the 19th Amendment is somehow missing from the history of the women's movement, I am also skeptical.

## roostersmiles, 1/3/2018 1:17:40 AM

What the public would choose typically is more fleeting and influenced by recent events. With recent movements to rename a lot of historical landmarks, the public does not like to be reminded of historical events that shed negative light based on modern sensibilities. 

## roostersmiles, 1/3/2018 1:04:16 AM

A more complex topic that overlaps with other articles is difficult to outline in a systematic way. We are so used to trying to clearly define where something ends and another thing begins. 
Similar to our own issues in building the DXProject outline.

## roostersmiles, 1/3/2018 12:55:41 AM

Is this because the write-ups keep getting deleted/revised when added.

## roostersmiles, 1/2/2018 9:55:17 PM

This is where multiple authors is helpful to fully illustrating alternative viewpoints and presenting them. Super helpful but it can be frustrating. At work we try hard to give each viewpoint some space but still presenting a level of degree as much as possible within a qualitative context. It is a tricky balance.

## roostersmiles, 1/2/2018 9:52:36 PM

https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2002/mar/03/internetnews.observerfocus

## roostersmiles, 1/2/2018 9:51:33 PM

Odd, I typically use Wikipedia to provide a definition for a term or concept. A bit more in depth I suppose than an entry in the Oxford Dictionary. 

## roostersmiles, 1/2/2018 9:48:55 PM

Love they reference Wikipedia about Wikipedia.

## roostersmiles, 1/2/2018 9:46:16 PM

I think Wikipedia has put in place mechanisms now to better vet content and their creators but find it interesting that something that started essentially being written by experts would flip so quickly in the interest of time.

## roostersmiles, 1/2/2018 9:40:37 PM

I agree, for some topics a common structure is very helpful, for others it might hinder the type of information shared/discussed. 

I think we should also ask how is it interpreted by those reading it? 

## roostersmiles, 1/2/2018 9:36:44 PM

A stark contrast to possessive individualism described above where not only does the author "lay claim" but also must be compensated for use of their work.

Wonderful that these open formats are almost viewed as owned by everyone as anyone can contribute.

## roostersmiles, 1/2/2018 9:33:03 PM

I think this is more intellectual possessive individualism, akin to Intellectual property, if it is collective work it is harder to reference and the "prestige" of the unique ideas is somehow lost. 

It is worrying that your reputation as an academic is tied to your "ownership" of thoughts and ideas.

## roostersmiles, 1/2/2018 9:30:03 PM

It might also be the nature of the work being done? I'd be interested to see if the divide is more experimental design research vs. literature review/interpretation rather than solely science / humanities & arts. Experimental design sometimes requires working collaboratively across many different task. Culture within the profession also likely plays into it.

## roostersmiles, 1/3/2018 2:54:49 AM

or a sense of "otherness" as need be. 

## roostersmiles, 12/5/2017 1:55:32 PM

Neatline is a pretty user friendly example of this that doesn't necessarily rely solely on Google Maps as the template.

http://neatline.org/ 

## roostersmiles, 12/5/2017 1:53:52 PM

The Agas Map is a good example of this http://mapoflondon.uvic.ca/map.htm

## roostersmiles, 12/5/2017 1:52:41 PM

I like that mapping is not limited to solely GIS based maps that are tied to geography but also more interpretive forms of maps. 

## roostersmiles, 12/5/2017 1:43:43 PM

If we are going to use them for something other than what most are familiar with them for, there needs to be some explanation. 

## roostersmiles, 12/5/2017 1:39:11 PM

It is an accessible way for most to organize and understand information. Visually representing something on a map comes with its own assumptions, as discussed in the Drucker article, but it is helpful especially as it relates to  a geographically focused historical event. 

## roostersmiles, 12/5/2017 1:02:26 AM

I think it also emphasizes the need to provide definitions for terms that may be contentious and the boundaries used for particular groups. 

## roostersmiles, 12/5/2017 12:56:52 AM

I also like where they are going with this, a review from an interpretive lens.

## roostersmiles, 12/5/2017 12:54:13 AM

I think it is important that digital humanities develop and expand its own methodologies, perhaps looking at the assumptions of others and improving upon them. I think there is value in a cross-discipline review.

## roostersmiles, 12/5/2017 12:52:57 AM

I'm not sure it is entirely true. A lot of decisions are statistical or using quantifiable measurements but there is still a lot to be said for qualitative and insight-based approaches and their use in human institutions. 
As much as clients ask us for % based answers to their research questions, we are still asked to do qualitative discussion-based research. The subjective or anecdotal insights often illustrate a point more effectively when presenting the results of a research project.

## roostersmiles, 12/5/2017 12:39:57 AM

I hope that once this moment passes that the study of digital humanities doesn't stop the use of visualization all together rather imposes some rigor on the use of these, as they can be very helpful and illustrative of the findings of the analysis. 

## roostersmiles, 12/5/2017 12:31:47 AM

I think they are trying to day the characteristics of the map that are uncertain are almost 'out of focus', but agree a visual example would assist with this argument.

## roostersmiles, 12/5/2017 12:19:18 AM

Wonderful - An important distinction. When describing a qualitative database or set I tend to stay away from percentages for this same reason. Think of a news headline X% said XYZ implies some sense of statistical relevance to a population. 

## roostersmiles, 11/23/2017 3:56:05 PM

Perhaps there is an opportunity to assist in finding out what works when and having it within the browser rather than the site. It does leave more of the manipulation up to the user and the content would need to allow for this manipulation. As an individual, being self aware would need to be important and having a tool that assists with this process of identifying what works/when might be helpful. 
I think this mirrors the debate about the creator's intent and expression vs.the users ability to access/experience this content. Again it comes back to the intent of the site/project and its use.

## roostersmiles, 11/19/2017 1:52:37 AM

Wonderful - For the general public in research we try to stick to an 8th grade reading level or lower. 

## roostersmiles, 11/19/2017 1:40:42 AM

Weird - We are using an alphabet that doesn't reflect the phonological structure of most of the languages we use it for and for some the letters are indistinguishable. Wonder what it is like with more morphological driven writing systems like Simplified Chinese.
A bit of a tangent but this made me think of a Freakenomics series I've been listening to. It has an interesting series on their podcast called Earth 2.0 where they are exploring how we would remake human systems if we could design them from scratch. Would we create a more efficient/universal language?

## roostersmiles, 11/19/2017 1:30:58 AM

Wonderful - I am currently going through the process of learning a new alphabet in my Pubjabi classes. The different hand writing styles of my teacher and the more advanced students compared to what is in our textbook can at times make it difficult for me to distinguish different letters. 
In English, the context tends to help with this (like homonyms) but with neurodiverse individuals this might work differently. 

## roostersmiles, 11/19/2017 1:09:02 AM

Would you not be able to find a font that works for you and use it kind of as your user default? Is it something more about the environment the font is in?

## roostersmiles, 11/19/2017 1:07:11 AM

Wonderful - Let the user drive the way they access your content. Technically, I'm not sure how to achieve this but love the direction.

## roostersmiles, 11/19/2017 12:57:39 AM

I think these examples are a great tie in to shawn's push to future proof our work. The underlying content can be manipulated in different ways by technology to cater to different needs.

## roostersmiles, 11/19/2017 12:53:41 AM

I think it is important to consider starting off from a point of accessibility as well as adapting for experiences but it might depend on the use case. 

In some video games for example, the use of sound in certain scenarios is meant to be a part of the narrative experience and gameplay that might ultimately change the narrative intended by the creator/author/designer if it was text-based or in another format. I think it parallels to translation depending on the medium, some nuance can be lost.

## roostersmiles, 11/18/2017 11:58:18 PM

I agree, this is an important point, it can be for everyone. When we build from an open accessible point to begin with we can improve the user experience for everyone by allowing alternate means to interact with a project/site/program. For example building better voice-navigation platforms for technology can benefit even those who are 'able-bodied'. 

## roostersmiles, 11/18/2017 11:52:35 PM

Wonderful - There is a choice you need to make as a designer, as a creator, who is the audience? Will you focus on the majority or those 'like me' or do you do the work to make it inclusive/accessible for others? It can be easy to do 'what works' and in some cases appropriate, but it depends on what you are doing and how you define your audience.

At work I get the line from some suppliers to include accessibility (WCAG 2.0 AAA) limits the user experience and find it frustrating that they are making a choice for us who our audience is. 

## roostersmiles, 11/18/2017 11:43:17 PM

What might make something work for one audience/group can often contradict others, sometimes design by subgroup is necessary. A fun puzzle.

## roostersmiles, 11/19/2017 2:19:59 AM

Can we connect with a character on the basis of their actions? It would be an interesting test two stories one with a 'normalizing' characteristic and one without to see how the view of narrative changes.

## roostersmiles, 11/19/2017 2:16:56 AM

This reminds me strongly of the discourse around the LGBTQ+ rights movement. 

## roostersmiles, 11/19/2017 2:15:47 AM

Wonderful - Interesting in the discussions I was involved in for Canadian Content in Digital, the focus was on cultural, linguistic and LGBT viewpoints in our cultural materials. The thought that diversity in content would drive acceptance and diversity in thinking, strengthening Canada's culture. It makes sense that 'disability' be included in this. I find myself struggling for a descriptor for this.

## roostersmiles, 11/19/2017 2:04:18 AM

Its interesting how we tend to focus on accessibility as it relates to vision but we don't see people wearing corrective tech (glasses/contacts) as having some disability. In other cases we see assistive or corrective tech as an identifier for those who are not 'able-bodied'.

## roostersmiles, 11/17/2017 2:04:06 PM

Cool, I've been doing the same at a slower pace on public opinion and policy.

## roostersmiles, 11/17/2017 2:01:48 PM

### Public Humanities

I was thinking of incorporating this into our discussion of the Public Humanities, often for divisive POR topics we will divide people into like-minded groups or do interviews because those with opposing views to the majority are more likely to stay silent. 

## roostersmiles, 11/17/2017 2:00:16 PM

### Public Humanities

I think this might depend on the platform, some platforms are broadcast, communicating to a wider collective while some are a bit more narrow. 

## roostersmiles, 11/17/2017 1:59:17 PM

### social media

Interesting, I've seen elsewhere that this trend started before the beginning of social media, it is interesting to see it eb and flow with this visualization.

## roostersmiles, 11/9/2017 1:45:15 AM

Similar to how text analysis rearranges text in order to better understand, we can rearrange visual information in the same way.

## roostersmiles, 11/9/2017 1:10:24 AM

A really interesting departure to focus on the pair. Even with love stories central to the plot of other 'Princess' movies, it is interesting that the relationship stories are still filmed similarly one-sided manner.

## roostersmiles, 11/9/2017 12:54:33 AM

A really cool re-purposing or re-application of a tool originally built for something else.

## roostersmiles, 11/9/2017 12:50:56 AM

I like this approach, taking a homogeneous corpus in terms of its genre or orientation while still varying to help highlight the changes and innovations over time.

## roostersmiles, 11/9/2017 12:43:52 AM

A reinterpretation of the format?

## roostersmiles, 11/9/2017 12:41:22 AM

The role of the analyst/researcher is still vital to interpreting and presenting the data. 

## roostersmiles, 11/1/2017 8:59:03 PM

This was very hard to do with one word.

## roostersmiles, 11/1/2017 8:58:36 PM

graphic

## roostersmiles, 10/29/2017 3:05:31 PM

We are bombarded with so much information these days I get this feeling of a need for a summary, how much information do we get just from news article headlines without diving into the materials. In the era of 'fake news' and limited attention spans a short and sweet summary with all of the pertinent info would be ideal. In practice though, not sure how much I would trust the computer generated summary.

## roostersmiles, 10/29/2017 2:57:00 PM

The act of building the dictionary itself can be daunting and a very manual process. Depending on the topic analysed it can make incorrect assumptions about the data. 

## roostersmiles, 10/29/2017 2:54:43 PM

I am curious what document level tools are available.


## roostersmiles, 10/29/2017 2:53:49 PM

### sentiment

This is the simplest form, sentance order drives alot of meaning, especially with adjectives and other descriptors which tend to drive sentiment. Finding a model that can read sarcasm, understand the context of the tweet or even just take syntax into consideration is difficult. There still needs to be a human check of the results in order to ensure they are in line. 

## roostersmiles, 10/6/2017 7:55:33 PM

### social media, sentiment

Interesting, I find while sentiment is difficult in general to automate, when I manually review searches Twitter tends to be fairly neutral with little polar differences, it is mostly informational (here is an article) with a little bit of outrage (I HATE THIS) rather than anything in between.

## roostersmiles, 10/24/2017 1:10:24 AM

I agree, the analyst brings in their own assumptions and context to a problem. 

## roostersmiles, 10/24/2017 1:01:44 AM

Curious how we might find this, pairing self-reported behaviour and identified characteristics of "experiences". This seems to be a case where a preference for quantitative and categorized data has trumped the benefits of qualitative analysis.

## roostersmiles, 10/24/2017 12:48:54 AM

Wonderful: The source of the data is always an important consideration for the analysis and appropriateness. When pulling from any source, the ability to replicate the research conditions is key.

## roostersmiles, 10/24/2017 12:42:26 AM

We also do it because we need to. The time investment required for reviewing 5000+ written submission manually with traditional qualitative analysis techniques makes large-scale public consultations difficult, the same goes for analyzing large sets of literature, or any corpus. A close read of a random sample of submissions with a distant read of all submissions allows us to take the key themes we saw up close and see how they are reflected in the whole. However this is still a fully qualitative approach.

## roostersmiles, 10/24/2017 12:35:32 AM

We see this alot in POR as well, qualitative research is often the best approach to meet the objectives for information gathering but because it doesnt produce statistically reliable #s some decision makers are worried about undertaking, even though the findings are valid and will inform decisions. After about 5 interviews you really start to hear the same things over and over again. 

## roostersmiles, 10/24/2017 12:29:21 AM

There seems to be an increased emphasis on quantitative and statistical data. I feel like there is a potential to loose the valuable qualitative and theme driven insights. Part of this is because of the rise of evidence-driven decision making, where decision-makers want one or two number to point to that drove their decision, reducing the potential for blow-back.

## roostersmiles, 10/24/2017 12:13:06 AM

### #text-anaytics

This is a great source of insights on applications of text analytics in research. 

## roostersmiles, 10/15/2017 8:03:04 PM

Ouch

## roostersmiles, 10/15/2017 7:36:31 PM

This reminds me of Optimality Theory, where the characteristics of a language are reflected by a list of constraints in a hierarchy.

## roostersmiles, 10/15/2017 7:31:56 PM

Wonderful: Different languages for different tasks. Is there a guide somewhere that helps in identifying which is best for which task... how many languages do the average developers know?

## roostersmiles, 10/15/2017 7:09:52 PM

Almost all of my coding skills and knowledge comes from Googling when I have encountered a problem and then replicating the response. 


## roostersmiles, 10/5/2017 3:59:17 PM

### linguistics

Wonderful: This reminds me of the Semantics course, where we discussed the different levels of meaning a word or concept has within a particular language. the word "apple" can be represented audibly, with a picture as well as written word. Each relate back to the same concept. 

## roostersmiles, 10/5/2017 3:59:06 PM

### old school data

Weird: Our internal teams at Ipsos still talk about the "old days" when our call centres would fly someone to Winnipeg to enter cards in from a survey into one computer to analyze the data.

## roostersmiles, 10/5/2017 2:34:58 PM

### research, statistics, gender

Worried: This survey is two years old so I did a quick search and it seems like it is still this pronounced (88%/7%). The survey methodology itself it a bit off, maybe women follow a different group of channels about coding than Stack? They recruited only through their own channels.
https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017#developer-profile-gender

## roostersmiles, 10/4/2017 6:01:18 PM

I wonder what the intellectual property implications are on copied code. I do the same thing often using snippets of someone else's solution.

## roostersmiles, 10/15/2017 6:59:43 PM

### public, research

Weird: I've done some research on this with the public and while they are not actively doing it, many people express that if they felt they needed to share their opinion about public policy or politics that they would go online first. Would be cool to compare to pre-internet measures if possible of those "engaged" in politics offline. 

## roostersmiles, 9/21/2017 12:07:23 PM

1. Text analysis
2. Crowds
3. Public Humanities
4. Visualization

## roostersmiles, 9/13/2017 11:22:32 PM

Wonderful: I think this is something that all sectors/disciplines should engage in to an extent. I'd love to see more collaboration on how together we can improve processes and coordinate efforts. 

## roostersmiles, 9/13/2017 11:14:50 PM

Wonderful/Worrying: Think of all the news articles posted that include the "public" perspective from twitter and the impact of technology use on access to news media. Local news is unstable, at least in Canada. How will that impact our identities as we see a more national picture? The PCH recently did a consultation about Canadian content in a digital world. The digital space is both making it easier and harder for us to define ourselves and share movies/art/music with others. 

## roostersmiles, 9/13/2017 10:55:23 PM

I always found the discussion of the potential impact of linguistic structures on how people see the world and express themselves in different cultures and contexts captivating. As well as the impact of social/political events on language shifts. It really is circular. 

## roostersmiles, 3/25/2018 10:04:34 PM

I wonder if we can in some ways compare the blogging of ideas to perhaps research notes or journals of past scholars, but in a public way. I would prefer if blogging were viewed more as 'ideas in development' rather than a stated published work similar to a peer reviewed article. If we can treat it as a way to spark debate and further discussion while forming ideas/opinions about a topic rather than as perhaps a finished product. 

I think the format and conventions of blogs, being opinion-based first-person accounts, lends it self well to this context. Blogging to me is a more subjective form than others.

## roostersmiles, 3/25/2018 9:58:26 PM

I'm not super familiar with history as a discipline, but I assume 'argument' here means supported opinion/interpretation as opposed to factual representation? A more subjective interpretation of events rather than a recital of knowns.

## roostersmiles, 3/25/2018 9:32:46 PM

I'm curious if 'ownership' here is in terms of profitability (financial or otherwise) of the debate or 'ownership' in terms of taking responsibility for shepherding/curating history. I think both have different implications on the future directions of digital humanities. 

Looking at the Indigenous Rights and Reconciliation debates in the Canadian political environment now,  I can't help but compare the 'ownership' of our past as a country and the connection to efforts (however effective/ineffective) for reconciliation. 

## roostersmiles, 3/25/2018 9:28:53 PM

I agree, respect is an important part of inclusion within the discourse. 

## roostersmiles, 3/25/2018 9:27:10 PM

I agree, access to the same internet is important but also the ability to use what they have accessed to. We talked about this in Accessibility as well, that language barriers, filters and other investments in infrastructure can limit the ability to 'level the playing field'. There is also the issues we discussed alongside Social Media, of discrimination and the individually different impacts of publicly discussing issues online.

## roostersmiles, 3/25/2018 9:10:56 PM

I think digital platforms might offer both, perpetual inaccuracies as well as the opportunity to open the  discussion about the origins of these inaccuracies and sharing additional context/perspectives. It might be easier to put ideas out there but making them heard can be difficult.

## roostersmiles, 3/25/2018 9:06:08 PM

I agree. It is super important to include a description of methodology for the ability for others to confirm, however with digital tools, I think doing this can be a bit easier to both keep track of yourself and to report to others. A researcher's notes were not necessarily published alongside their article, but with things like Github we can be more open about the process to getting to the conclusions in our research.

## roostersmiles, 3/25/2018 9:03:20 PM

This is really cool, I like the use of mapping to identify different points of conflict. The application to a broader discussion is important in terms of reconciliation. Police services use mapping to identify crime in neighbourhoods across our city, we can think about the social context in the same lens.

## roostersmiles, 3/25/2018 9:00:46 PM

I agree, looking at source materials in a new way can be really insightful. The example that really sticks with me is the colour blocking of Disney films in our discussion of visualization.

## roostersmiles, 3/25/2018 8:23:02 PM

It will be interesting to see how historical research is developed in the future, as we can "look back" at online social media and digitally archived data from the internet to provide additional context and "read" these on the street level conversations.

## roostersmiles, 3/25/2018 7:52:42 PM

I like the idea of imposing a structure and categorization on notes. We've started using NVivo for this at work across multiple streams of input and it is helpful to identify common threads over time.

## roostersmiles, 3/25/2018 8:15:13 PM

It also opens it up beyond academia, to allow those not necessarily committed to investing in tuition to access the same materials.

## roostersmiles, 3/11/2018 5:24:50 AM

I like how this mirrors back to the initial discussion to text mining, reminding us how the analyst/researcher brings prior knowledge and experience to the table in interpreting results. There is always an inherent bias/subjectivity in how the data is collected, interpreted and communicated.

## roostersmiles, 3/11/2018 5:21:25 AM

It seems to me that almost any length of speech has some meaning to it, a hedge or expression of doubt. It is interesting we are talking about sound here in relation to speech and the written word.

## roostersmiles, 3/11/2018 5:17:37 AM

I think I'm on the fence about this. DH seems to be rooted to me in the digital space, in visualization and mapping, as with other discussions, we saw the focus put on using the digital space in different ways. 

Text mining does seem more accessible, especially for English and Linguistics disciplines, where a quantified, linked and clustered model of the smallest unit of meaning (the word or more accurately a morpheme) is relevant. 

However, syntax, prosody and cadence are also significant in analyzing written and oral text, and perhaps needs more focus in this domain of DH.

## roostersmiles, 3/11/2018 5:14:29 AM

Thanks! I would have had to look this up as well. 

I'm a bit worried about the argument that the word is indisputable. There is a lot of ambiguity in how we use language and the intended meaning can often be lost in the written word. 

## roostersmiles, 3/11/2018 5:04:19 AM

I like this thought that text mining is somehow more familiar to most researchers in DH. 

## roostersmiles, 2/26/2018 12:09:51 AM

Interesting, I had thought the dicotomy was more "creative" like the use of creativity in the application of ideas/concepts in novel areas and "Creative" as those specifically within "Arts" disciplines.

## roostersmiles, 2/25/2018 11:52:46 PM

I like that the underlying message that perhaps our relationship with "productive" means of creativity is misplaced. We have too many things in our lives. 

Also, failure is helpful for innovation but not necessarily for productivity.

## roostersmiles, 2/25/2018 11:46:31 PM

I'm curious what the "above productivity" element is alluding to. Like we are not mass producing or that the outcome is not necessarily productively creative?

## roostersmiles, 2/25/2018 11:34:15 PM

"I made this"

## roostersmiles, 2/25/2018 11:16:02 PM

I think she is alluding to the groups they target by "purchase power" and spend within a category by easy to identify demographic characteristics (region, age, gender) rather than psycho-graphic characteristics (personality traits and needs) of the user. Depending on the product and needs this has started to shift, with niche marketing becoming easier and easier, although potentially less lucrative than the en-mass genres.

## roostersmiles, 2/25/2018 11:11:06 PM

Of simplifying the creative process? Or enabling a wider audience to be "creative".

## roostersmiles, 2/25/2018 11:08:14 PM

We used to make friendship bracelets by hand by tying knots... I may have at one point had a solid plastic "wheel" to assist the process and keep the strings separated. 

## roostersmiles, 2/25/2018 11:01:17 PM

Wonderful! I like the idea of engaging students with the creative process from a "peer" perspective. 

## roostersmiles, 2/25/2018 10:56:45 PM

It would be interesting to see what different paths were the most common among players. This might be an interesting research instrument for the role of different narrative devices in decision making/outcomes. Which pieces of information are essential for certain decisions at a later point in the game?

## roostersmiles, 2/25/2018 10:54:03 PM

Cool, seems like an easy approach. It seems like a similar approach to hypertext novels but with perhaps different goals and conventions.

## roostersmiles, 2/25/2018 10:38:00 PM

I agree, I also think its a great way to teach a concept through action. Attempting different permutations within a game and getting different results can help to solidify core concepts.

## roostersmiles, 2/19/2018 10:14:24 PM

I like that it is also an exploration of something more. By working with the photos you gain knowledge about the original intent of the photographer and context by purposefully or playfully altering it.

## roostersmiles, 2/5/2018 3:27:18 AM

worrying - studying radicalization to violence right now and troll behaviour seems linked between the online space and offline.

## roostersmiles, 2/5/2018 3:24:11 AM

a useful concept for our discussion of anonymity in the online context

## roostersmiles, 2/5/2018 3:20:00 AM

This is an interesting thought, deindividualized there is more room to be a troll and act inappropriately, but if start to regularly disclose otherwise anonymous user names in situations where there is harm done, would this change?

## roostersmiles, 2/5/2018 2:33:00 AM

The divide exists outside just digital scholarship

## roostersmiles, 2/5/2018 12:23:02 AM

This article highlights the difference between a digital focused public humanities and a public focused digital humanities. The public needs to be involved from the start and an understanding of the audience needs to be incorporated in the project.

## roostersmiles, 2/5/2018 12:16:30 AM

Compared to other projects where the audience is academic, these public projects must take into account a different common base of knowlegde as a starting point.

## roostersmiles, 2/4/2018 2:10:54 PM

This is one of the themes I wanted to discuss related to PH. the connection to authority and whether these discussions in the public space warp the perception of authority within the minds of the audience.

## roostersmiles, 2/4/2018 2:09:39 PM

Ok, so here Public Humanities is back to being made accessible for the public rather than by the public, but suggests that this approach needed to be reviewed.

## roostersmiles, 2/4/2018 2:08:11 PM

I like the connection to history as a service, preserving and making it available to the public. 

## roostersmiles, 2/4/2018 1:45:08 PM

Starting to see the argument here, that digital does not necessarily mean public. It cannot just be access by the public but needs to involve them in some way in the creation?

## roostersmiles, 2/4/2018 1:40:04 PM

Interesting the choice of word order impacts the relationship or perceived priority for the author between public and digital. Public Digital being first and foremost community focused in digital sphere while Digital Public being digitally focused in a public sphere. It surprises me because I had thought both were more closely integrated and would have pegged her definitions the other way. Interested to see where she goes with it.

## roostersmiles, 2/4/2018 1:36:52 PM

### defining PH

I like the illustrative description of "cracking open history" and the connection to democracy. Though I fear that a popular opinion approach to history needs to incorporate some critical thinking and added context.

## roostersmiles, 2/2/2018 3:00:44 AM

An interesting point, what return on investment can you get for the time spent on a DH blog. Writing experience and perhaps moderated discussions.

## roostersmiles, 2/2/2018 2:47:59 AM

This is a way to reach more people with your ideas. It really mirrors a lot of our initial discussions around crowds and social media.

## roostersmiles, 2/2/2018 2:45:07 AM

providing context again seen as really important

## roostersmiles, 2/2/2018 2:41:20 AM

I wonder what the audience is for these articles, given the expense and great lengths that people go through to publish. 

## roostersmiles, 2/2/2018 2:39:35 AM

Those established in an industry want to maintain the status qo or don't understand the process of some methods and so discourage their use. 

## roostersmiles, 2/2/2018 2:35:18 AM

The pressure to publish within academia. This seems akin to whether a self-published work is worth something to the discussion, reputation and future directions of the field. Is it 'worth' something typically translates to dollars. The author obviously places a lot of personal importance on this project and the work put in must be worth it or the site wouldn't exist.

## roostersmiles, 2/2/2018 2:31:11 AM

I think this sums up DH nicely, the audience it addresses is the Public perspective, who can access the scholarship.

## roostersmiles, 1/28/2018 5:39:06 PM

The social networks and connections made online have started to build the expectations. It is a marketplace of ideas.

## roostersmiles, 1/28/2018 5:05:23 PM

In talking to visible minorities about career options in the past there have been a lot of discussions about being careful to choose programs of study that will result in a professional career. Changing the narrative is important but also perception of the study of the humanities as a career path.

## roostersmiles, 1/28/2018 3:05:04 PM

In perception, expectation often informs our experience of an event, program or in this case artifact. If it does not meet our expectations of what it was thought to be going in, often the reaction is negative. 

## roostersmiles, 1/28/2018 4:36:33 PM

An interesting prediction, I wonder what else will shift in our lifetimes.

## roostersmiles, 1/28/2018 2:35:31 PM

Diversity is important across all fields. In other humanities disciplines and outside. I did research for DND on recruiting visible minorities to the CAF and this was similarly one of the key things that made it seem like a viable career option, seeing others like them in successful positions within the CAF.

## roostersmiles, 1/28/2018 2:02:56 PM

This raises an interesting issue, humans are fallible and capable of both constructive and deconstruction contributions to thought and debate. We are removing historical figures names from buildings, monuments and other places of honour who upon reflection have represented both important events in our collective history but also darker motives and causes. 
Over time societies social mores change, and our views of past events shift with these changes.

The impact new technologies can have in better understanding the past is awesome. 

## roostersmiles, 1/20/2018 10:31:41 PM

I agree as well, it is important that academia be able to perform this role, however political climate and financial pressures might not always mean it is possible. A part of it is also fear from the institution in some cases, when they may be afraid their funding would be impacted by challenging positions/pieces. 
I would be curious to see if anyone has reviewed this in a Canadian context and what the experience is at Canadian institutions. 

## roostersmiles, 1/20/2018 9:38:07 PM

This is why it is so important that we foster dialogue with individuals with different perspectives and backgrounds.

## roostersmiles, 1/20/2018 9:31:17 PM

Do the equalizing factors of technology push ideological shifts in some groups' perspectives on roles and inequalities within society, is it supporting a sentiment that was already present and facilitating the spread of ideas?

## roostersmiles, 1/20/2018 7:39:17 PM

Interesting: a tight network

## roostersmiles, 1/20/2018 7:37:07 PM

It is difficult to filter out noise, this is why a manual review is so important.

## roostersmiles, 1/20/2018 7:35:53 PM

A network of bots retweeting makes it difficult to distinguish 'real' data from fake. I like that they have developed a way to identify them. However, while the content they are posting is not a 'real' position on an issue in that it represents an individual, it is still being viewed and read by others, informing their opinions and leading to further polarization and influence. 

## roostersmiles, 1/20/2018 6:47:47 PM

### social media, methods

Cool, using existing models to extend and apply to existing models.

Like a proximity index?

## roostersmiles, 1/20/2018 6:14:33 PM

They started well before the election, interesting how their study of propaganda evolved.

## roostersmiles, 1/20/2018 5:58:41 PM

This is an important distinction. They are connected by the information that they are sharing but the sources are not all linked to the cause, they pick and choose what facts back them up.

## roostersmiles, 1/20/2018 5:25:10 PM

Cool! I had never thought about including the domains for links within my searches. Excited to try this.

## roostersmiles, 1/20/2018 5:19:33 PM

How did they identify the networks? Search based on a topic analysis.

## roostersmiles, 1/20/2018 5:15:04 PM

I like that this is a live update, interesting to see how it is shared. I love the idea of a public live monitor. I tend to do small scans on issues for clients that stay private.

## roostersmiles, 1/20/2018 5:12:54 PM

I'd really like to see the data from before the election and over time. Interesting to see that it has continued. 

## roostersmiles, 1/8/2018 8:20:23 PM

The categories on the margin are helpful if you were on an exploratory search.

## roostersmiles, 1/7/2018 5:29:13 PM

and disconnected from the companies that employ them. Work culture seems to be pushing toward the 'gig economy'. 

## roostersmiles, 1/7/2018 5:10:27 PM

very Marxist. Discussions around digital content creation often focus on bringing the means for mass communication down to the masses, however it seems in practice the power has again been given to a few to control. While anyone can create a blog, post a tweet or comment on social media, it is rare for it to gain attention or go viral without support by someone with more social clout, and even harder to make money for it. 
Some blogs, trying to remain independent, ask for donations from their readers in order to support the production of new materials. I wonder how successful they can be in breaking even or making a living this way.

## roostersmiles, 1/7/2018 4:55:29 PM

So true, we are seeing the music and film industries dealing with this in different ways now.

## roostersmiles, 1/7/2018 4:54:30 PM

Do we have an ethical obligation to refrain from this practice or to our shareholders to continue to exploit those willing to provide this work at a low rate in order to save on costs? How do you balance this as a decision-maker? 

## roostersmiles, 1/7/2018 4:52:09 PM

Do the designers who are not successful have the right to use their design again elsewhere or does the client who only paid the other own it? 

## roostersmiles, 1/7/2018 4:50:45 PM

Like a staffing agency?

## roostersmiles, 1/7/2018 3:59:34 PM

Is the issues the end goals of the organizations and the profit-driven approach of the 'corporate' intermediaries. Facebook would be OK if they were not selling our data? 

## roostersmiles, 1/7/2018 3:54:12 PM

The issues of 'screen-time' and the fear that we are doing something negative to our culture and society with the increased focus on online lives, that rather than augmenting our complimenting our lives we are somehow detracting from it. 

## roostersmiles, 1/7/2018 3:39:18 PM

Are we becoming this or has this been in process over the last century? The entertainment and advertisement industries have been using audience as a commodity for decades, we have started shifting it to other industries online.

## roostersmiles, 1/7/2018 3:36:51 PM

Similar to the 'contests' for content development or unpaid internships at big firms. Do the job to gain experience, but if a business can expect to get something for nothing its hard to start paying for it. It also though connects to the market's willingness to provide free labour and knowing the worth of your work product. Especially for those entering the workforce this can be hard to measure.

## roostersmiles, 1/7/2018 3:32:59 PM

Not totally related but made me think about the social media reaction to the new minimum wage increases in Ontario. In part the debate surrounds the redistribution of wealth and the willingness for those with power to forgo profit for an ethical understanding. 

## roostersmiles, 1/7/2018 3:17:21 PM

In contrast to the vast majority of small bloggers who take on both the direct costs and risk themselves, paying a service like Wordpress to host their content.

## roostersmiles, 1/7/2018 3:08:53 PM

Two or three years ago market research was all about the 'gamification' of data collection and participation in research. 

## roostersmiles, 1/7/2018 3:02:25 PM

Interesting - Scholtz spends so much time setting himself up as an expert in digital labour heading into the article. 

## roostersmiles, 1/7/2018 2:45:27 PM

Is it not enough or the feeling of a need to do more to stand out. The author connects it in part to the 2007-2009 recession, perhaps it is connected to the feeling even if you have a job that you need to somehow continue to 'do more' to get ahead.

## roostersmiles, 1/3/2018 3:10:09 PM

Perhaps another interesting source for analysis, this ongoing discussion behind the articles. I had never really considered looking beyond the information presented in the article. 

## roostersmiles, 1/3/2018 2:25:15 PM

If the government has helped pay for it, should it not be more open source? I understand the need to increase funding through subscription to continually update and increase the content developed. Maybe a not for profit with a recovery model works best.

## roostersmiles, 1/3/2018 2:20:07 PM

Wonderful! 

## roostersmiles, 1/3/2018 2:17:22 PM

The style described above of laying out objectively both sides of an argument and including little interpretation does leave alot wanting in terms of content. The bibliography section is a helpful starting point for further reading on a topic.
I think, depending on the use case, Wikipedia is helpful, in academia as a starting point or reminder of a concept while working on something more complex, but elsewhere as a high-level overview when a detailed complex understanding is not necessary.

## roostersmiles, 1/3/2018 2:12:11 PM

That is worrying that the open source data mining capabilities have meant the content being republished as is in a different format that may lend more credibility than is due. The concern I guess is the size of the audience reading misinformation compared to other encyclopedias (although the 25 article sample size is minimal). 

## roostersmiles, 1/3/2018 2:09:07 PM

What strikes me here is all the evidence presented that Wikipedia sources can be helpful and trustworthy. In academia, we have been told to avoid it as a source and to follow their sources if we do reference it to the original. Perhaps knowing the page history is available we can identify the original author of what we are citing, although the presence of something on Wikipedia may imply a larger parallel to a "peer review" just without the expert peers expected in a journal. 

Again, I expect those making changes on a particular topic are invested in it in some way, either professionally or personally. 

## roostersmiles, 1/3/2018 2:08:18 PM

If you go through the main page it seems to be also organised by topics and "portals". Its not how I tend to use it as the search engine method typically lets me answer the question I am looking for. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:History 

## roostersmiles, 1/3/2018 2:34:04 AM

I suppose it is simpler to correct a Wiki article, but what goes online is always there in some form. 

## roostersmiles, 1/3/2018 2:26:11 AM

Its interesting how even though the community has "appropriated" norms it is still viewed as not well written. 

## roostersmiles, 1/3/2018 2:09:35 AM

I like that it uses "general public" language. I imagine that many articles suffer from jargon within an industry as those with the greatest stake in a subject will contribute, but its a great corpus to see what prose a community defines as useful compared to an editor.

## roostersmiles, 1/3/2018 1:32:31 AM

That is pretty awesome

## roostersmiles, 1/3/2018 1:21:11 AM

If what the author indicates above that the 19th Amendment is somehow missing from the history of the women's movement, I am also skeptical.

## roostersmiles, 1/3/2018 1:17:40 AM

What the public would choose typically is more fleeting and influenced by recent events. With recent movements to rename a lot of historical landmarks, the public does not like to be reminded of historical events that shed negative light based on modern sensibilities. 

## roostersmiles, 1/3/2018 1:04:16 AM

A more complex topic that overlaps with other articles is difficult to outline in a systematic way. We are so used to trying to clearly define where something ends and another thing begins. 
Similar to our own issues in building the DXProject outline.

## roostersmiles, 1/3/2018 12:55:41 AM

Is this because the write-ups keep getting deleted/revised when added.

## roostersmiles, 1/2/2018 9:55:17 PM

This is where multiple authors is helpful to fully illustrating alternative viewpoints and presenting them. Super helpful but it can be frustrating. At work we try hard to give each viewpoint some space but still presenting a level of degree as much as possible within a qualitative context. It is a tricky balance.

## roostersmiles, 1/2/2018 9:52:36 PM

https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2002/mar/03/internetnews.observerfocus

## roostersmiles, 1/2/2018 9:51:33 PM

Odd, I typically use Wikipedia to provide a definition for a term or concept. A bit more in depth I suppose than an entry in the Oxford Dictionary. 

## roostersmiles, 1/2/2018 9:48:55 PM

Love they reference Wikipedia about Wikipedia.

## roostersmiles, 1/2/2018 9:46:16 PM

I think Wikipedia has put in place mechanisms now to better vet content and their creators but find it interesting that something that started essentially being written by experts would flip so quickly in the interest of time.

## roostersmiles, 1/2/2018 9:40:37 PM

I agree, for some topics a common structure is very helpful, for others it might hinder the type of information shared/discussed. 

I think we should also ask how is it interpreted by those reading it? 

## roostersmiles, 1/2/2018 9:36:44 PM

A stark contrast to possessive individualism described above where not only does the author "lay claim" but also must be compensated for use of their work.

Wonderful that these open formats are almost viewed as owned by everyone as anyone can contribute.

## roostersmiles, 1/2/2018 9:33:03 PM

I think this is more intellectual possessive individualism, akin to Intellectual property, if it is collective work it is harder to reference and the "prestige" of the unique ideas is somehow lost. 

It is worrying that your reputation as an academic is tied to your "ownership" of thoughts and ideas.

## roostersmiles, 1/2/2018 9:30:03 PM

It might also be the nature of the work being done? I'd be interested to see if the divide is more experimental design research vs. literature review/interpretation rather than solely science / humanities & arts. Experimental design sometimes requires working collaboratively across many different task. Culture within the profession also likely plays into it.

## roostersmiles, 1/3/2018 2:54:49 AM

or a sense of "otherness" as need be. 

## roostersmiles, 12/5/2017 1:55:32 PM

Neatline is a pretty user friendly example of this that doesn't necessarily rely solely on Google Maps as the template.

http://neatline.org/ 

## roostersmiles, 12/5/2017 1:53:52 PM

The Agas Map is a good example of this http://mapoflondon.uvic.ca/map.htm

## roostersmiles, 12/5/2017 1:52:41 PM

I like that mapping is not limited to solely GIS based maps that are tied to geography but also more interpretive forms of maps. 

## roostersmiles, 12/5/2017 1:43:43 PM

If we are going to use them for something other than what most are familiar with them for, there needs to be some explanation. 

## roostersmiles, 12/5/2017 1:39:11 PM

It is an accessible way for most to organize and understand information. Visually representing something on a map comes with its own assumptions, as discussed in the Drucker article, but it is helpful especially as it relates to  a geographically focused historical event. 

## roostersmiles, 12/5/2017 1:02:26 AM

I think it also emphasizes the need to provide definitions for terms that may be contentious and the boundaries used for particular groups. 

## roostersmiles, 12/5/2017 12:56:52 AM

I also like where they are going with this, a review from an interpretive lens.

## roostersmiles, 12/5/2017 12:54:13 AM

I think it is important that digital humanities develop and expand its own methodologies, perhaps looking at the assumptions of others and improving upon them. I think there is value in a cross-discipline review.

## roostersmiles, 12/5/2017 12:52:57 AM

I'm not sure it is entirely true. A lot of decisions are statistical or using quantifiable measurements but there is still a lot to be said for qualitative and insight-based approaches and their use in human institutions. 
As much as clients ask us for % based answers to their research questions, we are still asked to do qualitative discussion-based research. The subjective or anecdotal insights often illustrate a point more effectively when presenting the results of a research project.

## roostersmiles, 12/5/2017 12:39:57 AM

I hope that once this moment passes that the study of digital humanities doesn't stop the use of visualization all together rather imposes some rigor on the use of these, as they can be very helpful and illustrative of the findings of the analysis. 

## roostersmiles, 12/5/2017 12:31:47 AM

I think they are trying to day the characteristics of the map that are uncertain are almost 'out of focus', but agree a visual example would assist with this argument.

## roostersmiles, 12/5/2017 12:19:18 AM

Wonderful - An important distinction. When describing a qualitative database or set I tend to stay away from percentages for this same reason. Think of a news headline X% said XYZ implies some sense of statistical relevance to a population. 

## roostersmiles, 11/23/2017 3:56:05 PM

Perhaps there is an opportunity to assist in finding out what works when and having it within the browser rather than the site. It does leave more of the manipulation up to the user and the content would need to allow for this manipulation. As an individual, being self aware would need to be important and having a tool that assists with this process of identifying what works/when might be helpful. 
I think this mirrors the debate about the creator's intent and expression vs.the users ability to access/experience this content. Again it comes back to the intent of the site/project and its use.

## roostersmiles, 11/19/2017 1:52:37 AM

Wonderful - For the general public in research we try to stick to an 8th grade reading level or lower. 

## roostersmiles, 11/19/2017 1:40:42 AM

Weird - We are using an alphabet that doesn't reflect the phonological structure of most of the languages we use it for and for some the letters are indistinguishable. Wonder what it is like with more morphological driven writing systems like Simplified Chinese.
A bit of a tangent but this made me think of a Freakenomics series I've been listening to. It has an interesting series on their podcast called Earth 2.0 where they are exploring how we would remake human systems if we could design them from scratch. Would we create a more efficient/universal language?
https://open.spotify.com/episode/130rcuNMutYeYyOcWK3CVF

## roostersmiles, 11/19/2017 1:30:58 AM

Wonderful - I am currently going through the process of learning a new alphabet in my Pubjabi classes. The different hand writing styles of my teacher and the more advanced students compared to what is in our textbook can at times make it difficult for me to distinguish different letters. 
In English, the context tends to help with this (like homonyms) but with neurodiverse individuals this might work differently. 

## roostersmiles, 11/19/2017 1:09:02 AM

Would you not be able to find a font that works for you and use it kind of as your user default? Is it something more about the environment the font is in?

## roostersmiles, 11/19/2017 1:07:11 AM

Wonderful - Let the user drive the way they access your content. Technically, I'm not sure how to achieve this but love the direction.

## roostersmiles, 11/19/2017 12:57:39 AM

I think these examples are a great tie in to shawn's push to future proof our work. The underlying content can be manipulated in different ways by technology to cater to different needs.

## roostersmiles, 11/19/2017 12:53:41 AM

I think it is important to consider starting off from a point of accessibility as well as adapting for experiences but it might depend on the use case. 

In some video games for example, the use of sound in certain scenarios is meant to be a part of the narrative experience and gameplay that might ultimately change the narrative intended by the creator/author/designer if it was text-based or in another format. I think it parallels to translation depending on the medium, some nuance can be lost.

## roostersmiles, 11/18/2017 11:58:18 PM

I agree, this is an important point, it can be for everyone. When we build from an open accessible point to begin with we can improve the user experience for everyone by allowing alternate means to interact with a project/site/program. For example building better voice-navigation platforms for technology can benefit even those who are 'able-bodied'. 

## roostersmiles, 11/18/2017 11:52:35 PM

Wonderful - There is a choice you need to make as a designer, as a creator, who is the audience? Will you focus on the majority or those 'like me' or do you do the work to make it inclusive/accessible for others? It can be easy to do 'what works' and in some cases appropriate, but it depends on what you are doing and how you define your audience.

At work I get the line from some suppliers to include accessibility (WCAG 2.0 AAA) limits the user experience and find it frustrating that they are making a choice for us who our audience is. 

## roostersmiles, 11/18/2017 11:43:17 PM

What might make something work for one audience/group can often contradict others, sometimes design by subgroup is necessary. A fun puzzle.

## roostersmiles, 11/19/2017 2:19:59 AM

Can we connect with a character on the basis of their actions? It would be an interesting test two stories one with a 'normalizing' characteristic and one without to see how the view of narrative changes.

## roostersmiles, 11/19/2017 2:16:56 AM

This reminds me strongly of the discourse around the LGBTQ+ rights movement. 

## roostersmiles, 11/19/2017 2:15:47 AM

Wonderful - Interesting in the discussions I was involved in for Canadian Content in Digital, the focus was on cultural, linguistic and LGBT viewpoints in our cultural materials. The thought that diversity in content would drive acceptance and diversity in thinking, strengthening Canada's culture. It makes sense that 'disability' be included in this. I find myself struggling for a descriptor for this.

## roostersmiles, 11/19/2017 2:04:18 AM

Its interesting how we tend to focus on accessibility as it relates to vision but we don't see people wearing corrective tech (glasses/contacts) as having some disability. In other cases we see assistive or corrective tech as an identifier for those who are not 'able-bodied'.

## roostersmiles, 11/17/2017 2:04:06 PM

Cool, I've been doing the same at a slower pace on public opinion and policy.

## roostersmiles, 11/17/2017 2:01:48 PM

### Public Humanities

I was thinking of incorporating this into our discussion of the Public Humanities, often for divisive POR topics we will divide people into like-minded groups or do interviews because those with opposing views to the majority are more likely to stay silent. 

## roostersmiles, 11/17/2017 2:00:16 PM

### Public Humanities

I think this might depend on the platform, some platforms are broadcast, communicating to a wider collective while some are a bit more narrow. 

## roostersmiles, 11/17/2017 1:59:17 PM

### social media

Interesting, I've seen elsewhere that this trend started before the beginning of social media, it is interesting to see it eb and flow with this visualization.

## roostersmiles, 11/9/2017 1:45:15 AM

Similar to how text analysis rearranges text in order to better understand, we can rearrange visual information in the same way.

## roostersmiles, 11/9/2017 1:10:24 AM

A really interesting departure to focus on the pair. Even with love stories central to the plot of other 'Princess' movies, it is interesting that the relationship stories are still filmed similarly one-sided manner.

## roostersmiles, 11/9/2017 12:54:33 AM

A really cool re-purposing or re-application of a tool originally built for something else.

## roostersmiles, 11/9/2017 12:50:56 AM

I like this approach, taking a homogeneous corpus in terms of its genre or orientation while still varying to help highlight the changes and innovations over time.

## roostersmiles, 11/9/2017 12:43:52 AM

A reinterpretation of the format?

## roostersmiles, 11/9/2017 12:41:22 AM

The role of the analyst/researcher is still vital to interpreting and presenting the data. 

## roostersmiles, 11/1/2017 8:59:03 PM

This was very hard to do with one word.

graphic

## roostersmiles, 10/29/2017 3:05:31 PM

We are bombarded with so much information these days I get this feeling of a need for a summary, how much information do we get just from news article headlines without diving into the materials. In the era of 'fake news' and limited attention spans a short and sweet summary with all of the pertinent info would be ideal. In practice though, not sure how much I would trust the computer generated summary.

## roostersmiles, 10/29/2017 2:57:00 PM

The act of building the dictionary itself can be daunting and a very manual process. Depending on the topic analysed it can make incorrect assumptions about the data. 

## roostersmiles, 10/29/2017 2:54:43 PM

I am curious what document level tools are available.


## roostersmiles, 10/29/2017 2:53:49 PM

### sentiment

This is the simplest form, sentance order drives alot of meaning, especially with adjectives and other descriptors which tend to drive sentiment. Finding a model that can read sarcasm, understand the context of the tweet or even just take syntax into consideration is difficult. There still needs to be a human check of the results in order to ensure they are in line. 

## roostersmiles, 10/6/2017 7:55:33 PM

### social media, sentiment

Interesting, I find while sentiment is difficult in general to automate, when I manually review searches Twitter tends to be fairly neutral with little polar differences, it is mostly informational (here is an article) with a little bit of outrage (I HATE THIS) rather than anything in between.

## roostersmiles, 10/24/2017 1:10:24 AM

I agree, the analyst brings in their own assumptions and context to a problem. 

## roostersmiles, 10/24/2017 1:01:44 AM

Curious how we might find this, pairing self-reported behaviour and identified characteristics of "experiences". This seems to be a case where a preference for quantitative and categorized data has trumped the benefits of qualitative analysis.

## roostersmiles, 10/24/2017 12:48:54 AM

Wonderful: The source of the data is always an important consideration for the analysis and appropriateness. When pulling from any source, the ability to replicate the research conditions is key.

## roostersmiles, 10/24/2017 12:42:26 AM

We also do it because we need to. The time investment required for reviewing 5000+ written submission manually with traditional qualitative analysis techniques makes large-scale public consultations difficult, the same goes for analyzing large sets of literature, or any corpus. A close read of a random sample of submissions with a distant read of all submissions allows us to take the key themes we saw up close and see how they are reflected in the whole. However this is still a fully qualitative approach.

## roostersmiles, 10/24/2017 12:35:32 AM

We see this alot in POR as well, qualitative research is often the best approach to meet the objectives for information gathering but because it doesnt produce statistically reliable #s some decision makers are worried about undertaking, even though the findings are valid and will inform decisions. After about 5 interviews you really start to hear the same things over and over again. 

## roostersmiles, 10/24/2017 12:29:21 AM

There seems to be an increased emphasis on quantitative and statistical data. I feel like there is a potential to loose the valuable qualitative and theme driven insights. Part of this is because of the rise of evidence-driven decision making, where decision-makers want one or two number to point to that drove their decision, reducing the potential for blow-back.

## roostersmiles, 10/24/2017 12:13:06 AM

## roostersmiles, 10/15/2017 7:36:31 PM

This reminds me of Optimality Theory, where the characteristics of a language are reflected by a list of constraints in a hierarchy.

## roostersmiles, 10/15/2017 7:31:56 PM

Wonderful: Different languages for different tasks. Is there a guide somewhere that helps in identifying which is best for which task... how many languages do the average developers know?

## roostersmiles, 10/15/2017 7:09:52 PM

Almost all of my coding skills and knowledge comes from Googling when I have encountered a problem and then replicating the response. 


## roostersmiles, 10/5/2017 3:59:17 PM

### linguistics

Wonderful: This reminds me of the Semantics course, where we discussed the different levels of meaning a word or concept has within a particular language. the word "apple" can be represented audibly, with a picture as well as written word. Each relate back to the same concept. 

## roostersmiles, 10/5/2017 3:59:06 PM

### old school data

Weird: Our internal teams at Ipsos still talk about the "old days" when our call centres would fly someone to Winnipeg to enter cards in from a survey into one computer to analyze the data.

## roostersmiles, 10/5/2017 2:34:58 PM

### research, statistics, gender

Worried: This survey is two years old so I did a quick search and it seems like it is still this pronounced (88%/7%). The survey methodology itself it a bit off, maybe women follow a different group of channels about coding than Stack? They recruited only through their own channels.

Weird: I've done some research on this with the public and while they are not actively doing it, many people express that if they felt they needed to share their opinion about public policy or politics that they would go online first. Would be cool to compare to pre-internet measures if possible of those "engaged" in politics offline.

Wonderful: I think this is something that all sectors/disciplines should engage in to an extent. I'd love to see more collaboration on how together we can improve processes and coordinate efforts.

Wonderful/Worrying: Think of all the news articles posted that include the "public" perspective from twitter and the impact of technology use on access to news media. Local news is unstable, at least in Canada. How will that impact our identities as we see a more national picture? The PCH recently did a consultation about Canadian content in a digital world. The digital space is both making it easier and harder for us to define ourselves and share movies/art/music with others.

I always found the discussion of the potential impact of linguistic structures on how people see the world and express themselves in different cultures and contexts captivating. As well as the impact of social/political events on language shifts. It really is circular.
