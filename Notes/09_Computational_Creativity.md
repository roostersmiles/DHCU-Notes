Interesting, I had thought the dicotomy was more "creative" like the use of creativity in the application of ideas/concepts in novel areas and "Creative" as those specifically within "Arts" disciplines.

I like that the underlying message that perhaps our relationship with "productive" means of creativity is misplaced. We have too many things in our lives. 

Also, failure is helpful for innovation but not necessarily for productivity.

I'm curious what the "above productivity" element is alluding to. Like we are not mass producing or that the outcome is not necessarily productively creative?

"I made this"

I think she is alluding to the groups they target by "purchase power" and spend within a category by easy to identify demographic characteristics (region, age, gender) rather than psycho-graphic characteristics (personality traits and needs) of the user. Depending on the product and needs this has started to shift, with niche marketing becoming easier and easier, although potentially less lucrative than the en-mass genres.

Of simplifying the creative process? Or enabling a wider audience to be "creative".

We used to make friendship bracelets by hand by tying knots... I may have at one point had a solid plastic "wheel" to assist the process and keep the strings separated.

Wonderful! I like the idea of engaging students with the creative process from a "peer" perspective.

It would be interesting to see what different paths were the most common among players. This might be an interesting research instrument for the role of different narrative devices in decision making/outcomes. Which pieces of information are essential for certain decisions at a later point in the game?

Cool, seems like an easy approach. It seems like a similar approach to hypertext novels but with perhaps different goals and conventions.

I agree, I also think its a great way to teach a concept through action. Attempting different permutations within a game and getting different results can help to solidify core concepts.
