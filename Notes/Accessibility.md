## Lecture Notes
- A11Y - shortform for Twitter, 
- Accessibility what does it include/not include
General
- Assistive technology
- sensory accessibility - visual, auditory, speech
- motor - physical learning, kinesthetic
- visible vs. non-visible
- cognitive - colourblindness
Digital
- broad format for assistive tech
- intrinsiclly accessible vs. adaptive
- interoperability (raw formats) - content across areas
- Laptop/mobile accessibility - availability across platforms/devices
- usability - UX - interaction or use of content, use of language
- problems platforms bring up that are different from traditional
- context specific
Bias and sterotypes
- belief - able = norm, abnormal
- put onus on 'disabled' to adapt to us rather, disability defined through consensus
- age, disability - 'getting old' - issues faced the same
- assistive vs. adaptive
- adaptive - sits on top of other technology, make it accessible
- assistive - perform with current abilities - hearing aides, ramps, eye glasses etc...
- more comfort with assistive
### Where?
Public Spaces
- assumptions - about access (accompanying), retrofit has to fit on exisitng design
- history of accessibility - university platform for learning - does disabiling, 
- online government - convience, public facing accessible, min requires, moving to universal design
- online shopping, public space?, difficult if inflexible
- implimentation different - democratic process, action/strike/rallies, participation different
- stats can - definitions of disability - 11% aggregated - unemployment
- social participation - language access, difficult to participate in shared experience
- localised social networks - adverse effect on mental health, social cohesion - othering
- translation platform, changing translation - based on concenus? interpretation of policy
- accessibility can be contextual
- attending class virtually difficult. 
- plain language in academia - known for thick
- theoretical levels, build context to contribute
- Paeget - cog development - assimulating in mental models - change to accomodate new
- imposter syndrom - credibility, presitge, professionalisation - box in to better define
- use of shortcuts makes it inaccessible as well - final publication need to stay or be 'translated' to allow access
- power dynamic - oral traditions/ history reliance on text - dominant narrative - value expert over experience
### Activity
- relatability - bring to their experience level, assimulate the knowledge
- information to share but get information across without complexity. 
### Compliance online
- WCAG 2.0 - advisory body W3 for web content
- align as many as possible, imprvements over time - changing
- W3C guidance around coding, content oriented
- up to developpers to be requirement but meaningful
- interoperable/robust - consistency in interpretations
- use of colour
- captioned media - alternative format/text 
### Activity #2
### Social constructs
- othering, intrisiclly different
- perspective of contribution from inside - content inside container- where value lies, contribute to create knowldge in experience
- differently abled - 
- universal design, not every situation
- thread within academis - use of laptops in the class room, power relationships
- laptop free zones
- building social communities on shared experiences
- not disabled - differently abled
- what is doing the disabiling? 
- tendancy to build for others like us
- ethical design manifesto - design firm, own copy - remixed
- simple easy framework to make case - not complex issues
- human experience not easily comparmentalized
- inclusion is doing with, why justifies exclusion
