## Paul Ford: What is Code? - https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/#what-do-different-languages-do 
- had trouble reading this all at once. I really appreciated the informal voice and tutorials built into the article.

This reminds me of Optimality Theory, where the characteristics of a language are reflected by a list of constraints in a hierarchy.

Wonderful: Different languages for different tasks. Is there a guide somewhere that helps in identifying which is best for which task... how many languages do the average developers know?

Almost all of my coding skills and knowledge comes from Googling when I have encountered a problem and then replicating the response.

### linguistics

Wonderful: This reminds me of the Semantics course, where we discussed the different levels of meaning a word or concept has within a particular language. the word "apple" can be represented audibly, with a picture as well as written word. Each relate back to the same concept.

### old school data

Weird: Our internal teams at Ipsos still talk about the "old days" when our call centres would fly someone to Winnipeg to enter cards in from a survey into one computer to analyze the data.

### research, statistics, gender

Worried: This survey is two years old so I did a quick search and it seems like it is still this pronounced (88%/7%). The survey methodology itself it a bit off, maybe women follow a different group of channels about coding than Stack? They recruited only through their own channels.

I wonder what the intellectual property implications are on copied code. I do the same thing often using snippets of someone else's solution.
