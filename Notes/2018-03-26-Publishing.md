- transcribe bantham - tried to get scholars to make sense of it
- journals and capitalism - couple in planned obsolescence, university publishing houses, how much $$ they make, doesnt have to be this way. More like a business - could transform structure to have uni invest into it, rather than depend on sales
- business model by crowd funding, content creators to lone wolf it - less middle men
- don't phsycially have it - can someone take it away from you, in a sense have it everywhere
- reputation economy in academia related to publishing, purchase the name of journal, edit produce,40-50% off of you to take it 
- critical consumers, if in X journal must be good
- open publishing event- name behind, if trying to put it out there, reputation of journal itself - everything top notch, they own your work for ever
- Shawn - embargo on digital version for 2 years, negoiating 
- want to share digital copy with students, pulled out of it
- digital would undermine sales
- ROMEO - review of open sourced articles
- archives - can keep a copy of it, lodge copies - get unique tracking to it, when it is cited get caught, findable not hidden
- academia.edu - for profit

- technically, depending how we define publishing - posted to public - "publishing"
- public facing draft- unsettles people to have partially finished
- same platform for a book
- ability to go back and edit
-- interesting the discussion of the shift of tech in process of writing even - notes and organisation and essential need to start with more organised research before typing compared to the ability to build and edit recursively
- reader is the least important person in this system
trying to plot it out can be useful
- conference on data publishing and final article - raw or cooked data - amazing the push back on idea of sharing the data, which quarters it was coming from. 
- if <60 - precariously employed more interested in open data and publishing rather than others
- closed data - pay for with data mortgages, only if you share mine, closed-linked data? - computer applications in archeology conference (40 years), senior group of archeology - GIS was the thing - computation and data you hold on to, others might do something to it
- Grad student - NDA - not publish using data with full knowledge of group
- metho and data - needed for replicability - what value does publisher add, 
- other models available -trying to pretend don't exist, can get people to do it for free

- peer review - get an e-mail saying we have this paper, please review and give someone else otherwise, no reward
- anonymity - collect gossi[/settle scores]
- women use first name rather than inital and last name
- increasingly active reader - contrast with rap genious or hypothesis fosters
- could conceive of online annotations as publishing.
- Self-publishing - novels and other things, even academically - rigourus process - months to do.
- not the same as other examples - Kindle and E-books think it has been mediated but could finish it in five minutes
- online journals overhead is cheaper
- scarcity of knowledge - with print - not justify the price use production as a reason
- cost per book - scarcity previous but now less
- imperial press - did give a good copy editor and marketing - historian's macroscope
- fan fiction - 
hypertext - hyperguard
