# DHCU-Notes
This is my repository of notes and thoughts across the various themes and discussions throughout our semester. It includes my raw lecture notes and reading notes where digitally available as well as some notes from DH events I attended this past academic year. 

# DX-Project
This is the notes and materials I created to help us organise our project, including the visualisation of the layout of the textbook and outline. My discussion guide and summary for my chapter are also in this folder.
